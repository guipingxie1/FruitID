The skin is smooth and velvety, golden orange with slight rosy blushing, depending on variety. The fruit contains a loosely connected central pit. Younger apricots will be slightly firm, and somewhat sweet, yet lacking developed flavor as they ripen even after they are harvested. Ripe apricots are sweetforward with a slightly tart finish and a juicy, tender mouthfeel. The apricot, Prunus armeniaca, is a species of the genus, Prunus. It is classified as a stone fruit alongside plums, cherries, peaches, mangoes and almonds. The apricot has become the parent fruit along with plums, peaches and nectarines for dozens of successful interspecific hybrids such as pluots and apriums. Apricots are classified into three groups: Central Asian, Persia-Caucasian and European. There are dozens of different apricot cultivars that are bred for early, mid and late season ripening, superior flavor, flesh quality, coloring and even the ability to withstand long-term shipping. Popular apricot names include Blenheim, Sungold, Wilson Delicious, Hunza and Royal Rosa. The apricot is native to and originally discovered in the mountainous regions of north central and north western China. Trade routes, exploration and time would spread the fruit from Asia into Europe and eventually the New World. Most New World apricots are of European origins. Central Asian apricots are still relatively new to North American growers as they do not have the visual appeal of plumper European varieties yet they are considered to be the most delicious in fruit flavor and texture. Apricot trees are fairly disease resistant and do not respond well to fertilizers. Fertilizers encourage weak growth and make trees more susceptible to disease and insects.

Less commonly grown are the Chinese varieties, which have a more traditional pear shape with bulbous bottom and elongated top, similar to that of European pears. Prized for their crunchy texture the creamy white flesh of the Asian pear is exceptionally juicy with a sweet low acid flavor and fragrant aroma. Unlike regular pears Asian pears are sold ripe and maintain their crisp texture long after being picked. Careful handling must be practiced when picking, packing and transporting Asian pears as their delicate skin bruises and becomes discolored easily. There are thousands of different known varieties of Asian pears, each varying slightly in shape and color.

This tart, short-seasoned berry prefers the help of sugar and the richness of fat to bring out its best characteristics. The black currant berry is larger and has a thicker skin than other currant berry varieties.

    "Black Fig": {
        "description": "Black Fig Black Mission fig \"fruit\" has a tough peel (in this case, green giving way to deep purple), often cracking near the stem end upon ripeness, and exposing the pulp beneath. The soft creamy white interior contains a seed mass bound with jelly-like flesh. The edible seeds are numerous and generally hollow, unless pollinated. Pollinated seeds provide the characteristic nutty taste of dried figs. Figs grow on the Ficus tree (Ficus carica), which is a member of the Mulberry family. There are almost two hundred cultivars of figs, thus they grow in a wide range of shapes, colors and textures. The common fig bears a first crop, called the breba crop, in the spring on last season's growth. The second crop is born in the fall on the new growth and is known as the main crop. Figs are botanically an inverted flower. Each fig is not a single fruit, but nearly fifteen hundred tiny fruits. Figs made their first commercial product appearance with the 1892 introduction of Fig Newtons\u00ae Cookies. Figs are one of the very first plants to be cultivated by humans. They have been documented throughout history as a food source for over 11,000 years. They were first cultivated in ancient Egypt though they are believed to be indigenous to western Asia. They still have a huge presence in northern Africa and throughout the eastern Mediterranean, specifically Greece and Turkey. They have been naturalized in the western Mediterranean and throughout temperate regions of the United States, primarily Southern California. The Black Mission Fig is native to the Balearic Islands, an archipelago of Spain in the western Mediterranean Sea. Spaniards brought the fig to America in 1520. The (California) Mission fig received its given name in honor of the missionary fathers - priests at Mission San Diego, who originally planted figs in California in 1769. In the late 1880s, fig orchards covered much of the area within the city limits of Fresno, the heart of the central San Joaquin Valley, the largest agricultural sector of California. Figs require full sun all day to ripen palatable fruits. Cold springs and cloudy summers can lead to a dismal fig season.",

Cantaloupes have been developed over time to achieve uniform size, improved flavor and disease resistance. This high level of consistency has contributed to the Cantaloupe becoming the most widely eaten melon variety in America today.",

The flesh has a meaty, custard-like texture with a flavor that is similar to its aroma: a combination of savory, sweet and pungent, often compared to rotting fruit, with notes of banana, caramelized onion and aged blue cheese.\n\nSeasons/Availability\nDurian is a seasonal fruit that can bear two crops yearly. Harvests are in spring and summer, depending on region.\n\nCurrent Facts\nThere are more than 100 cultivars of Durian, yet one variety dominates the international marketplace: Durio ziebethinus or Mon Thong, also called golden pillow. Durian are called \"Mountain Cat\" in Mandarin and as Mao Shan Wang in Cantonese. When ripe, the fruit will have a slight give and be golden in color with soft, creamy yellow flesh. Separate the seeds from the flesh before eating, and cut from the opposite end of the stem. Recently, research has pinpointed 41 highly odor-active compounds associated with the Durian's prominant odor. Interestingly, 24 of the odor-producing compounds discovered were new to science.\n\nNutritional Value\nDurian is rich in sugar, carbohydrates, fatty acids and protein; it is high in nutrients, particularly sulfer. Durian also contains Vitamin C and is rich in antioxidants specifically flavonoids, beta-carotene and anthocyanins. When compared to unripe and overripe Durian the ripe Durian offers the highest antioxidant content.\n\nApplications\nDurian fruit is well-suited to preparations where the flesh is pureed or blended. The large, fleshy seeds may be roasted or boiled and eaten as nuts. Use the flesh in batters for cakes and baked goods, custards, purees and ice creams. Pair with other tropical fruit such as mangosteen and mango, or alongside sticky rice or coconut cream. Wear protective gloves when slicing and removing the edible pods from the spiky skinned fruit. For best flavor and quality use within one week.\n\nEthnic/Cultural Info\nOutside of Asian communities, Durian is a relatively unknown fruit in America. Exposure to the food community via media exploitation has attributed to its cult status.\n\nGeography/History\nThe Durian tree is native to Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia and may have originated in Gua Musang in the Kelantan state of Malaysia. It prefers highly tropical climates near sea level and has thus been naturalized in other Southeast Asia and Far East countries, including Thailand, Sri Lanka, Singapore and the Polynesian Islands. Though Durian can be found in many local markets in the countries in which it is harvested, the fruit is shipped internationally only from Thailand and Indonesia, where it is grown for commercial production.",

        "full": "Gala Apple\nDescription/Taste\nGala apples are covered in a thin yellow to orange skin, highlighted with pink to red stripes that vary in hue dependent upon the apples maturity. Their dense flesh is creamy yellow and crisp, offering a mildly sweet flavor and flora aroma. Gala\u2019s that are allowed to reach the peak of their sweetness on the tree will have a deeper red hue and a slightly sweeter flavor.\n\nSeasons/Availability\nGrown in both the southern and northern hemisphere, Gala Apples are available year-round.\n\nCurrent Facts\nA cross between Golden Delicious and Kidd\u2019s Orange Red, the Gala apple is currently one of the most extensively grown apples in the world. It has an impressive lineage, being related as well to both the Delicious and Cox Orange Pippin varieties. It is also parent to several varieties such as the Jazz, Royal Gala and Pacific Rose.\n\nNutritional Value\nGala apples are a great snacking fruit as they are low in calories, high in water content and offer a fair amount of vitamins A, C and B. They also contain a dietary fiber known as pectin, which has been shown to lower cholesterol levels and help prevent heart attacks. They also contain trace amounts of boron, which has been touted for its ability to help build strong bones.\n\nApplications\nThe delicate flavor and texture of the Gala apple shines in fresh preparations. They are perfect for use in fruit, green and chopped salads. Add diced gala to fruit salsas and chutneys. Slice and add to burgers, paninis and crostinis. Their sweet flavor becomes milder when cooked making them perfect in baked preparations when paired with stronger flavored apples such a Granny Smith, Arkansas Black, Pippin and Mutsu. The flavor of pears, winter squash, onions, pecans, turkey, curry, brie, cheddar and Swiss cheese complement Gala apples.\n\nGeography/History\nGala apples were developed in New Zealand in 1934 by apple breeder J.H.

    "Gold Tamarillo": {
        "description": "Gold Tamarillo Golden tamarillo fruit is egg-shaped with a glossy tangerine hued skin and succulent flesh containing small soft edible seeds. The skin is thin and far too bitter and tannin rich for palatable human consumption. Its flesh, though, when ripe, is bright and piquant in flavor with a pleasant sweet tart balance. The Golden tamarillo, botanical name Cyphomandra betacea, AKA tree tomato, is a member of the Solanaceae family which includes tomatoes, potatoes, tobacco and pepper plants. The Golden tamarillo is native to the Andes mountains of Peru. It has been cultivated on Peruvian mountainsides since pre-Columbian times. It is grown on a small scale from Chile to Venezuela. On the Colombian and Ecuadorian uplands, it is found in every city from Bogot\u00e1 to Quito. Regardless of its widespread cultivation throughout the subtropics, it is still considered a garden variety fruit and has yet to be heavily exploited on a commercial level. During the second half of the 20th century New Zealand established the first commercial level orchard production. Horticulturists selected tree tomato types, developed improved varieties, naturalized the fruit and named it tamarillo in 1967. It was the first country to establish a new standard designated name for the fruit and expand tamarillos into international trade, exporting to Japan, North America and Europe. Tamarillo trees are generally propagated from seed and are self-compatible, requiring no pollination, though bee pollinated flowers improves fruit production.",

Various parts of the Guanabana tree have been used for centuries by medicine men and native Indians in South America to treat ailments such as heart disease, asthma, liver problems and arthritis.\n\nGeography/History\nThe Guanabana was first written about in the 16th century, during which time it was abundant in the West Indies and the northern parts of South America. The Guanabana tree was one of the first fruit trees taken from the Americas to the Old World Tropics. Since then, it can be found in Australia, southern China, Vietnam, and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in the Dominican Republic and is one of the most popular fruits in Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, Colombia and northeastern Brazil. It can also be found growing in Hawaii and southern Florida. In 1951 a Professor in Puerto Rico who was encouraging the development of the Guanabana told a professor of agriculture in the United States that he wanted to adopt a different name for the fruit in the US. He didn\u2019t think the name soursop was very appealing and was concerned Guanabana was too difficult to pronounce. To this day, a better name has not been found.",

Though there are hundreds of varieties of avocados, the Hass avocado has become the benchmark avocado for commercial production. Its long growing seasons, prolific fruit production and shipping tolerance are virtues that make the Hass the standard market avocado. It is the avocado that the general public identify as simply, an avocado. The name avocado comes from the fruits original Aztec name, aoacatl or ahuacatl. After being discovered and mispronounced by the Spanish, and then the English, the fruit made its way to Jamaica where it was called many things including avocado and alligator pear. In Florida the first avocados were introduced by the West Indies as \"alligator pears\" and was known as such on the eastern coast until The American Pomological Society and the U.S. Department of Agriculture adopted \"avocado\" as the commercial name for the fruit. The Hass avocado is native to La Habra Heights, California where groves of avocado trees still flourish today. The very first Hass avocado tree was planted from seed (an avocado pit) in the early 1920's by A.R. Rideout.

New Zealand kiwifruit is available in spring and supplies arrive from Chile during the summer months.\n\nCurrent Facts\nAccording to the California Kiwifruit Commission, kiwi fruit were the fastest-growing fruit in sales and distribution from 1987 to 1995.\n\nNutritional Value\nKiwifruit is rich in vitamin C, having ten times more than the equal weight of a lemon. Two fruits have almost twice the vitamin C of an orange and more potassium than a comparable serving of bananas.  High in fiber, it also offers vitamin A, Vitamin E, calcium and iron. Credit goes to all those little black seeds, as they act much like grains, providing lots of nutrition.\n\nApplications\nPuree; enhance juices and beverages. Even though the skin is edible, the fruit is usually peeled. Slice for garnish. Containing a meat-tenderizing enzyme, place sliced peels with some flesh attached directly on meat; marinate thirty minutes for each inch of the meat's thickness. To make a kiwifruit salsa, blend four peeled kiwis, one teaspoon minced jalape\u00f1o pepper, one tablespoon orange juice, one tablespoon chopped fresh mint and a pinch of salt. Serve with grilled swordfish, grilled poultry and roast pork. Bananas, berries, mangoes, strawberries, raspberries and oranges are especially partial to kiwifruit. To store, refrigerate ripe fruit up to ten days. Refrigerated unripe fruit lasts up to one month.\n\nEthnic/Cultural Info\nThe French word, souris vegetale, for this fruit translates to \"vegetable mouse\".\n\nGeography/History\nNative to the Yangtze River Valley of northern China and Zhejiang Province on the coast of eastern China, this fruit was first grown commercially in New Zealand. England received their very first kiwifruit shipment in 1953. Not frost-tolerant, the vigorous woody twining vine or climbing shrubby plants require a long growing season. Only fully dormant plants can survive temperatures around ten degrees Fahrenheit. The rambling vines are capable of stretching to cover an area ten to fifteen feet wide, eighteen to twenty-four feet long and nine to twelve feet high. Producing deep green leathery-textured oval to round leaves that can grow seven to ten inches in diameter, fragrant one to two inch wide white to cream colored flowers appear in the leaf axils. In the United States, California produces about ninety-nine percent of the nation's kiwifruit supply.",

The flesh is translucent yellow and juicy when ripe. Its juice is highly acidic and tart, though extremely versatile in its uses. Depending on variety, lemons may contain no seeds or numerous seeds. The true lemon, Citrus limon is known as limone, lim\u00f3n, lim\u00f3n agria, lim\u00f3n real, or lim\u00f3n franc\u00e9s. It is a member of the family, Rutaceae. Most common commercial lemon varieties are either Lisbon or the Eureka lemon, of which hybrids of the Eureka lemon are even more common as they are improved versions of the original. Most other true lemon varieties are grown in gardens or for limited production on a local market scale. The lemon's origins are traced back to northern India, where the lemon tree still grows wild. Lemons were then cultivated in Africa, Europe and eventually the New World. Lemons are known to tolerate drought and poor soil, though they are cold sensitive and require some rainfall for continuous growth. They grow most prolifically in Mediterraneanesque climates. Lemon trees that undergo stress will produce far less yields and inconsistent quality fruits. Original lemon cultivars were propagated by seed but modern varieties are grown on rootstock of both lemon and other citrus varieties.

The edible translucent white flesh bears a single central dark brown nut which doubles as the fruit's seed. The flesh's texture is jelly-like, chewy and juicy.

The Lychee tree is a sub-tropical and tropical tree that is native to Southern China and Malaysia. Wild Lychee trees are one of the dominant tree species of tropical rainforests in Southern China. The Lychee tree has been naturalised throughout Asia as well as in other regions in the Western and Southern Hemispheres with similar climates and terrain. Non-native regions are not always ideal for growing though, often leaving trees with limited crops due to inconsistent fruit bearing. Two elements of successfully domesticating Lychee trees are irrigation and flowering. Once shoots are established, irrigation is held the second autumn those shoots mature.

Frozen fruit is best used in soups, marinades, salad dressings, entr\u00e9e or dessert sauces and for baking. Uncooked papaya does not congeal in commercial gelatin with an animal protein base. It may be used with agar, a seaweed base. When making papaya chutney or jam, use a commercial pectin or other fruits that have an abundance of pectin.\n\nEthnic/Cultural Info\nThe Hawaiian Islands are also major producers of papaya and at one time they used this fruit to feed chickens and pigs! Today, it is a favorite on many menus and more mainland consumers are discovering this island delicacy. Papaya is not to be confused with \"pawpaw\", the American custard apple. Australians use \"pawpaw\" to mean papaya.\n\nGeography/History\nA New World fruit, papaya is native to South and Central America. Its name is derived from the Spanish adaptation of the word \"ababai\" from pre-Columbian communities in the Caribbean. Dating back to prehistoric times, dozens of varieties of papaya exist today. Mexican papaya grows in Mexico and is imported into the United States.",

The flesh is perfumed with aromatics, overtly juicy when ripe, and golden colored with red bleeds at the skin and surrounding the central rough pit. A ripe nectarine's texture is soft with a melting quality, its flavors balanced with layers both bright and sweet. Nectarines are the result of a natural occurring genetic mutation of the peach. Nectarines, botanical name, Prunus persica nucipersica, are a stone fruit and species within the genus, Prunus, alongside cherries, apricots, plums and almonds. There are two types of nectarines: yellow-fleshed and white fleshed. White-fleshed nectarines are typically low or sub-acid while yellow-fleshed nectarines are both sweet and tart. The definitive origin of nectarines is unknown.  Documentation of the first nectarine was recorded in English in 1616. As peaches are native to central Asia, though, there is geographical speculation that the first nectarine was found growing on a peach tree within the same region and trade routes brought it to Europe in the 15th century. Genetic studies have concluded that nectarines are created due to a recessive allele.  Without two copies of a gene, specific genetic traits will not be inherited. Thus, the nectarine naturally evolved as a fuzz-free peach.  The lack of fuzz contributes to the fruit's brighter colorings and to its ability to bruise more easily.  Nectarines still occur as bud mutations on peach trees.  The trees' preferred climate is similar to that of the peach. Their growing regions are regulated by the seasons.

Subspecies include Damsons, Bullace and Greeengage. All plums share the same percentage of naturally occurring sugars, which is 10%.  However fruit breeding since the 19th century has increased plum cultivars' sugar content to reach above 20%. The benchmark plum variety is the Santa Rosa plum, a Japanese plum developed in America by Luther Burbank in 1906. Plums' greatest offspring is perhaps the pluot, a plum-apricot hybrid created to meet the demands of evolving palates. Japanese plums have origins in China but were first domesticated in Japan.  European plums evolved as a hybrid of the cherry plum and wild blackthorn (the wild plum of Europe and western Asia). American plums are native to North America.

However fruit breeding since the 19th century has increased plum cultivars' sugar content to reach above 20%. The benchmark plum variety is the Santa Rosa plum, a Japanese plum developed in America by Luther Burbank in 1906. Plums' greatest offspring is perhaps the pluot, a plum-apricot hybrid created to meet the demands of evolving palates.\n\nApplications\nPlums are a versatile culinary ingredient with possible uses centuries old.  They can be used for fresh eating, preserved using various methods, including pickling and of course, they can be dried to prune form. Plums can be used as a salad ingredient, as a compote for savory applications, used as the principle ingredient in desserts such as cakes, crumbles and ice creams and they can even be the base for a summer vinaigrette. Plums have a wide array of culinary pairings that are both savory and sweet.  Such pairings include anise, arugula, basil, cherries, chiles, cinnamon, cream, dates, figs, chocolate, nectarines, peaches, citrus, pork, lamb, aged and fresh cheeses, lettuce greens, almonds, pistachios, grilled scallops, brandy, red wine and light-bodied vinegars.\n\nGeography/History\nJapanese plums have origins in China but were first domesticated in Japan.  European plums evolved as a hybrid of the cherry plum and wild blackthorn (the wild plum of Europe and western Asia). American plums are native to North America. Each species is responsible for the hybridization of thousands of plum subspecies and varieties. All plums grow on flowering shrub-like trees that blossom in the spring, produce fruit in the summer and shed their foliage in the winter months.  Trees can reach up to 10 meters in height depending on variety. Plum trees are grown by grafting budwood onto rootstock. A common tree chosen for rootstock is the Cherry plum.  It is especially used for European varieties. Other common rootstock varieties include St. Julien, Pixy and the most versatile and hardy, the Viking.",

The skin is inedible and is smooth and covered in a fuzzy brown coat. When ripe its flesh is yellow orange to red brown in color with a soft and juicy texture. The center of the fruit contains a seed cavity, which holds between three and twelve smooth and flat brown seeds. The seeds are also inedible. A Sapodilla\u2019s flavor is sweet due to the existence of high quantities of fructose and sucrose. Its texture and flavor has been compared to that of pear. Sapodillas should be allowed to ripen at room temperature and are ready to eat when firm with a slight give to them, similar to that of a ripe mango.\n\nSeasons/Availability\nSapodilla are available in spring time and can be found online from small farms that ship their specialty fruit or possibly at a local farmers market.\n\nCurrent Facts\nSapodilla, botanically known as Manilkara zapota, is also known as Chico sapote, Zapotillo, Chicle, and in India is known as Chikoo. The Sapodilla tree is a slow growing evergreen and has long been cultivated not only for the tropical fruit it produces but for the latex extracted from the bark of the tree known as chicle, an ingredient that is commonly used to make chewing gum.\n\nNutritional Value\nChikoo as it is known in India is used for its anti-inflammatory benefits. It is also a good source for dietary fiber. In Indian medicinal practices it is used for its anti-viral, and anti-bacterial properties as well.\n\nApplications\nSapodillas are most commonly enjoyed fresh, simply served halved and the flesh eaten straight from the skin. They are excellent chilled or at room temperature. Sapodilla flesh can be used in both fruit and green salads. Puree cooked or raw Sapodilla to make sauces and syrups. Add pureed fruit to custards, puddings and whipped cream. Add to batter for pancakes, muffins and quick breads. Slice and use in a tart or pie. Be sure to remove the seeds before serving. Once ripe keep Sapodillas in the refrigerator and use within a week.\n\nGeography/History\nSapodilla trees are believed to be native to Southern Mexico and the Yucatan. They have been grown throughout Central America since ancient times and can also be found growing in the West Indies, Bermuda, the Philippines and the Florida Keyes.

    "Sapote": {
        "description": "Sapote The White sapote is a fruit that must be handled with care from cultivation to harvest. The ideal White sapote fruit is rounded or somewhat oval, averaging roughly 3 to 4 inches in diameter.  The skin is thin, lime to lemon lime green in color and lightly coated with a thin bloom.  The flesh is filled with vanilla aromatics, ivory in color with yellow tones near the skin and surrounding the seeds within the flesh.  Any given fruit can bear one to six plump hard inedible and potentially toxic seeds.  The flavor of the fruit is nectar sweet with notes of banana and pear, its texture tender and custard-like.  Less ideal White sapotes will have bitter tones offsetting the fruit's sweetness and the flesh can become pasty and resinous if picked too early, picked poorly or allowed to mature too long.  The level of pollination and weather conditions can also affect the fruits' appearance, flavor and texture.  It is not rare to have entire fruit trees void of pollination, creating fruits with no seeds at all.  Mature fruits are picked with the stem still slightly attached to the fruit to prevent bruising.  The stem eventually falls off, revealing the fruit's peak ripeness. The name sapote actually refers to several cultivars including the highly regarded fruit, mamey sapote.  There are Black sapote cultivars and in this case, the White sapote, which is the singular sapote fruit to belong to the Rutaceae family.  The White sapote, known as zapote Blanco in its native region, is the most common sapote fruit and a distant relative of the citrus family.  The White sapote fruit is cultivated and sold strictly as a fresh market fruit as it does not ship well.  It is not sold commercially for post-harvest processing either as it has been classified as not suitable for canning, freezing or pur\u00e9eing, specifically because of its low acid content. The common White sapote is found indigenously growing wild and cultivated in Central Mexico.  It is also grown in subtropical high elevation regions of Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica.  In Central America the White sapote trees are planted as a shade tree on coffee plantations. The White sapote does not like heavy desert conditions nor does it tolerate too much humidity.  It prefers acidic soil and has greedy roots, often reaching up to fifty feet long. The White sapote was introduced to California in 1810, yet the state's mostly temperate fruit growing regions do not readily accommodate the classic White zapote varieties, often producing less than edible fruits. There have been decades of research and hundreds of acres of Southern California orchards dedicated to developing successful new varieties of White sapote (Chestnut, Suebelle, Chapman, Bravo and Vinner) which can produce more fruits than can be physically eaten.  Regardless, the White sapote's horticultural relevance remains minor within America.",

        "description": "Tomatillo Tomatillos vary from one inch in diameter to plum-size and resembling the green cherry tomato, the tomatillo, pronounced tohm-ah-TEE-oh, is much more lustrous and much firmer. Tomatillos are enclosed in a wrapper-like husk or calyx, creating an appearance of an oriental lampshade. Easily peeled away, the fruit is inside this web-like and dry parchment-colored covering. Having a unique gelatinous texture, the flesh offers a sweet and spicy flavor with a citric edge. This fruit is most often cooked to develop its excellent flavor. The raw fruit has a sharp acidic taste. The tomatillo means little tomato and is just one of nearly one hundred Physalis species. This group has fruits that are commonly enclosed in papery calyxes and are called \"Chinese lantern plants\"  because of this unusual formation. The tomatillo is also called a Spanish tomato not because it is known in Spain but because it is native to and grows in Mexico. Another name is green tomato as it remains green even when ripe. It is also sometimes referred to as husk tomato or Mexican husk tomato. Traditionally, tomatillos are especially a favored ingredient in New Mexican and Mexican dishes. Easy to grow, tomatillos were a staple food in ancient Mayan and Aztec communities. First introduced into India in the 1950s, it remains very popular there where it is commonly made into chutney.",

        "description": "Ugli Fruit Ugli fruit, is wrapped in a rough, puffy, slightly loose-fitting greenish-yellow to orange fragrant skin. Ranging in size from an overgrown navel orange to a hefty grapefruit, the nearly seedless pinkish-orange or sunshiny yellow-orange pulp contains tender large juice sacs that offer a soft fleshiness. The fruit is similar to a grapefruit with one important distinction: It is sweet, unlike the grapefruit and does not have a tart after taste. The older the fruit looks on the outside, the sweeter it is on the inside. Its acid-sweet, zesty, pungent flavor is somewhat reminiscent to that of an orange. Some fans say it tastes more like a mandarin with faint overtones of pineapple or honey. Ugli fruit, botanically known as Citrus reticulate X paradise, was named and trademarked in 1934 when an importer of the fruit specifically ordered \"...more of that ugly fruit...\". Ugli fruit, pronounced OO-gli, is a natural tangelo hybrid between a grapefruit, seville orange and a tangerine. The original Ugli fruit importer has used improved scions to create the version of the fruit we know today. Ugli\u2122 fruit is also sold under the moniker Uniq fruit. Ugli fruit was discovered growing wild in 1924 by a gentleman named F.G. Sharp at Trout Hall, near Brown\u2019s Town in Jamaica. Ugli fruit was developed commercially by the same family which discovered the original tree and was originally marketed as The Exotic Tangelo from Jamaica.
