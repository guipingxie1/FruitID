Akebi Fruit
http://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/sppics/9541.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Akebi fruit has a purple color not often seen in nature. It is the size of a russet potato and is soft to the touch. A slice can be removed from the thick rind of a domesticated Akebi fruit, whereas the wild grown fruits must be allowed to split on their own indicating ripeness. Inside of the Akebi fruit is a sweet translucent white flesh (similar in look and texture to a lychee) with a taste somewhat like pear. The flesh is filled with shiny black seeds.

Seasons/Availability
Akebi fruit is only available for two weeks out of the year; its season is at the very beginning of fall.

Current Facts
Akebi fruit is both wild and cultivated. The exotic looking fruit is found in Japan during a very brief period at the end of the summer or early fall. Because of the short availability, distribution is somewhat limited to just a few stores and in limited quantity.

Applications
The inner flesh of the Akebi fruit is usually eaten fresh, slurped from the purple pod. Seeds can be spat out or eaten; it can be difficult to remove them from the gelatinous flesh. The pod itself can be cooked and is used very much like a vegetable in traditional Tohoku cuisine. It is stuffed, sautéed and deep fried. The taste of the rind is bitter; to mellow the flavor, soak the unopened pod in water for thirty minutes to an hour.

Geography/History
Akebi fruit is native to the northern Tohoku region of Japan, and has only been cultivated and available commercially in the last few decades. Research into the Akebi fruit has found that it has antiseptic and diuretic properties.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Apricot_and_cross_section.jpg/500px-Apricot_and_cross_section.jpg
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Apricots are one of the smaller stone fruits. Their shape is rounded yet oblong. The skin is smooth and velvety, golden orange with slight rosy blushing, depending on variety. The fruit contains a loosely connected central pit. Younger apricots will be slightly firm, and somewhat sweet, yet lacking developed flavor as they ripen even after they are harvested. Ripe apricots are sweetforward with a slightly tart finish and a juicy, tender mouthfeel.

Seasons/Availability
Apricots are available in the late spring through summer.

Current Facts
The apricot, Prunus armeniaca, is a species of the genus, Prunus. It is classified as a stone fruit alongside plums, cherries, peaches, mangoes and almonds. The apricot has become the parent fruit along with plums, peaches and nectarines for dozens of successful interspecific hybrids such as pluots and apriums. Apricots are classified into three groups: Central Asian, Persia-Caucasian and European. There are dozens of different apricot cultivars that are bred for early, mid and late season ripening, superior flavor, flesh quality, coloring and even the ability to withstand long-term shipping. Popular apricot names include Blenheim, Sungold, Wilson Delicious, Hunza and Royal Rosa.

Applications
Apricots can be eaten raw, dried, pureed, roasted, grilled, baked or cooked into jams. The kernels (pit) of Central Asian varieties are also roasted and used to make apricot kernel oil. Apricots pair well with other stone fruit, including cherries, almonds and plums. They can be utilized for fresh fruit salads, for savory salads and appetizers and for desserts. Other complimentary pairings include honey, egg custards, seafood such as scallops and prawns, lavender, lemon, orange, cardamon, pistachio, cayenne, pepitas, mascarpone, burrata, chevre, vanilla, white chocolate, yogurt, hazelnut and olive oil. Apricots can be added to cakes, muffins and cookies and be made into ice cream and gelato.

Geography/History
The apricot is native to and originally discovered in the mountainous regions of north central and north western China. Trade routes, exploration and time would spread the fruit from Asia into Europe and eventually the New World. Most New World apricots are of European origins. Central Asian apricots are still relatively new to North American growers as they do not have the visual appeal of plumper European varieties yet they are considered to be the most delicious in fruit flavor and texture. Apricot trees are fairly disease resistant and do not respond well to fertilizers. Fertilizers encourage weak growth and make trees more susceptible to disease and insects. The trees love full sun, hot dry summers and sheltered cool to cold but frost-free winters. Fruits will crack under humid, wet conditions.

Hass Avocado
http://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/sppics/949.png
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Persea_americana_fruit_2.JPG/500px-Persea_americana_fruit_2.JPG
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The Hass avocado is known for its quintessentially tumbled leathery fairly thick skin that turns near black when fully mature. The flesh closest to the skin is a lush colored pale lime green and as it nears the central pit it develops a rich creamy yellow tone and softer, oil rich texture. Hass avocado's flavor reflects its texture - creamy and smooth with a nutty and sweet finish.

Seasons/Availability
Hass avocados' seasons vary depending on the growing region. California avocados are in season from February through October. When they are not in-season, they can be found growing in Chile, Peru and Mexico, though summer Mexican crops have a tendency to have an overly rich oil content.

Current Facts
Though there are hundreds of varieties of avocados, the Hass avocado has become the benchmark avocado for commercial production. Its long growing seasons, prolific fruit production and shipping tolerance are virtues that make the Hass the standard market avocado. It is the avocado that the general public identify as simply, an avocado. The name avocado comes from the fruits original Aztec name, aoacatl or ahuacatl. After being discovered and mispronounced by the Spanish, and then the English, the fruit made its way to Jamaica where it was called many things including avocado and alligator pear. In Florida the first avocados were introduced by the West Indies as "alligator pears" and was known as such on the eastern coast until The American Pomological Society and the U.S. Department of Agriculture adopted "avocado" as the commercial name for the fruit.

Nutritional Value
Depending on the time of year, the avocado's fat content varies. In the early part of the harvest season, California avocados have a fat content close to 2 grams per ounce, while later in the year, they can peak at 6 grams per ounce. Avocados are rich in dietary fiber, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin E, potassium and folate and are a good source of mono-unsaturated fat.

Applications
To halve and pit a ripe avocado, cut in half lengthwise until reaching the center stone. Twist the two halves in opposite directions to separate. Remove the pit with a spoon. Carefully peel away skin. Avocados may be mashed, cubed or sliced, stuffed or pureed. To store, ripen fruit at room temperature. Refrigerate when ripe. Once ripe, use promptly for optimum flavor and texture.

Geography/History
The Hass avocado is native to La Habra Heights, California where groves of avocado trees still flourish today. The very first Hass avocado tree was planted from seed (an avocado pit) in the early 1920's by A.R. Rideout. He sold a seedling to Rudolph Hass and it was that seedling that turned a single seed into a ubiquitous tree fruit. Rudolph Hass appropriately named the tree after himself and patented the fruit in 1935. The tree that launched millions more trees would bear fruit for 80 years before finally giving way to root rot, not uncommon among avocado trees. Although they need an incredible amount of water to bear healthy fruit consistently, avocado trees cannot tolerate overly irrigated soil or an abundance of rainfall.  They prefer arid regions and semi tropical regions with well aerated soil.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Florida Avocado
http://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/sppics/365.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Florida avocados are easily distinguishable from other avocados in both appearance and flavor. Unlike Hass avocados, most Florida avocado varieties' skin does not turn color when ripe. The skin is smooth, kelly green and mottled with the occasional brown streak. The skin is firmly attached to the fruit's flesh, yet easy to peel away. The flesh is cornflower gold, soft yet pliable, high in moisture content with a melting quality. The fruit has a large central pit, yet because of the fruit's size (often weighing over a pound) edible yield is still high. Its flavors display subtle notes of grass and nuts such as almonds and filberts.

Seasons/Availability
Florida avocados are available mid-summer until late winter/early spring.

Current Facts
Avocados, botanical name Persea americana, are members of the family Lauraceae, which includes the plants that produce edible cinnamon, camphor, sassafras and the herb laurel (bay leaf). The Florida avocado received its given name due to its current growing region, Florida, where there are at least 50 different varieties of avocados that grow. Avocados were first introduced into Florida via the West Indies with the moniker "alligator pears", a name no longer used today. Florida is known for and markets its larger avocado varieties that tend to produce more quality and consistent fruit. The most successful commercial varieties include Doni, Lula, Bernecker and Pollock.

Nutritional Value
Avocados have nutritional advantages over other fruit. Sustenance-wise, they contain the highest source of protein of all fruits. They are also high in fiber, folate, Vitamin E and they have 60 % more potassium than bananas per serving.

Applications
Avocados are simply suited for fresh eating or processing into a chilled soup and they serve as the principle ingredient in guacamole. Best culinary pairings include citrus, tomatoes, salt, herbs such as cilantro and basil, alliums including garlic and onions, bacon, beef, sausages, seafood, legumes, fresh, aged and blooming rind style cheeses, summer squash, cucumbers, cumin and chiles. To speed ripening, place in a paper bag and keep at room temperature. Avocados ripen within three days after harvest and should be consumed once the fruit yields to gentle pressure. Once exposed to air, the fruit's color browns, thus it is recommended to apply citrus as a preserving agent.

Geography/History
Avocados evolved as a species from animals eating the fruit and "distributing" the seeds. Avocados have been growing wild for at least 13,000 years though chosen varieties have been cultivated by humans for about 9,000 years. There are three races of avocados: Guatemalan, Mexican and West Indian. While each has distinctive features, cross-pollination permits the development of unlimited varieties. Florida avocados are native to Mexico, Central America and parts of South America. Avocados were first introduced to Florida in 1833 by Henry Perrine. Florida is credited with being the first State in America to cultivate avocados.

Bilva Fruit
http://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/sppics/10639.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The immature pale green skin of the Bilva fruit becomes sunshine yellow then a mottled brown when ripe. Roughly about the size of a large orange, the outer skin of the Bilva fruit can be described as woody and hard and must be cracked open using a stone or hammer. Within the hard shell of the Bael fruit are many seeds growing in small cavities surrounded by a fibrous flesh and a fruity and aromatic, juicy pulp. Bilva fruit tastes similar to Passion fruit. When sliced and dried, the fruit resembles bicycle wheels.

Seasons/Availability
The Bilva fruit can be found growing year-round in tropical climates, with a peak season in the fall months.

Current Facts
Bilva fruit is botanically known as Aegle Marmelops, from the Bael Tree and is often called ‘Stone apple’ or Bilwa. Bilva fruit is a member of the citrus family. The tree itself is worshipped as Lord Shiva’s tree in India and its three-lobed leaves are used in the ceremonial worship of the deity. The Santhal tribes in India worship the tree as a totemic deity. Indians sometimes refer to the Bilva tree as 'the fruit of plenty' because it serves as a sustaining food as well as a medicine.

Applications
Known in Hindi as "Bel," Bilva fruit is eaten either fresh or dried. The dried fruit is crushed into a powder and used in candy, or reconstituted in water and drained in a sieve for beverages. In India a popular thirst quencher is made with Bilva fruit and jiggery, which is evaporated raw sugarcane juice.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
In Ayurvedic medicine, every part of the Bilva tree can be used for medicinal purposes. The immature Bilva fruit is roasted under mud, pureed and mixed with water and sugar or buttermilk to be used as an anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial, as well as for the treatment of digestive issues and diabetes. The fruit is also said to be good for the heart and the brain. Also called Bilwa, the tree and fruit are considered to be emblems of fertility in India.

Geography/History
The fruit, also known as Bengal Quince, is native to India and has likely existed since 2000 BC when the first of the Indian Vedas, or sacred texts, were written. Bilva trees can be found growing in and around most Shiva temples in India. The tree also grows in dry arid soil of Vietnam, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The fruit is foraged in the jungles and on the hillsides in India and is most commonly found in farmer’s markets.

Banana
http://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/sppics/919.png
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/3_Bananas.jpg/500px-3_Bananas.jpg
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The Cavendish banana has a thick signature yellow peel when perfectly ripe, encasing an ivory cream colored, semi-starchy flesh. Depending on its age, the flavor and aromatics can vary from nuances of lemon custard to creme brulee. The banana plant is not a tree, but the world's largest herb. The fruit itself is botanically a berry.

Seasons/Availability
Bananas are available year-round.

Current Facts
The banana is the most important fruit within the global culinary landscape. Although not necessarily superior in flavor or production quality, the common banana commercially sold is known as the Cavendish banana. Due to the demise of a now-extinct variety, the Gros Michel, or "Big Mike," in the late 1960's, the Cavendish has dominated the market since the 1970's. The banana has a highly regarded culinary value as it is one of the world's most accessible and ideal foods: it is nutritious, convenient, affordable and always growing. It also turns out that each Cavendish banana growing throughout the world is a direct clone of one another, identical twins to the first one discovered in Southeast Asia, in shape, size and flavor.

Nutritional Value
Bananas are well known for their potassium rich flesh. Bananas also full of other nutrient health boosters including vitamin B, C, fiber, and magnesium. They are more calorie dense than most other fruits, making them an extremely efficient and sustainable small meal. Bananas are considered an excellent source of the amino acid tryptophan as well as vitamin B6, which in conjunction helps the body produce serotonin in the brain.

Applications
Cavendish bananas are the quintessential fresh-eating banana, but they are also considered a standard among dessert bananas. They can be utilized as an ingredient in smoothies, yogurts, cereal, cakes, muffins, breads, ice cream, cookies, pudding and more. Favorable pairings include tropical friends such pineapple, guava and mango, cinnamon and nutmeg, granola, chocolate, vanilla, stone fruits, berries, lemon and lemon zest and caramel.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Bananas are also the 4th most popular agricultural product in the world. Each year over 100 billion bananas are consumed worldwide. Americans on average eat 27 pounds of bananas per person every year. Ninety-six percent of households in America buy bananas at least once a month with 51 percent of those bananas being eaten at home for breakfast. The highest average per capita consumption of bananas in the world is in Uganda. Ugandans eat an average of 500 pounds of bananas per person every year. Bananas impact food security and income generation for more than 100 million people. Fun fact: the banana has had more songs written about it than any other fruit and bananas first appeared in written history in the 6th century B.C.

Geography/History
Cavendish bananas were first cultivated in relative obscurity in Southeast Asia. They were brought to a Caribbean botanical garden in the early part of the 20th century and put into commercial production in the 1960's. Their culinary dominance is due to their resistance to Panama disease. But in 1992, a new strain of the fungus was discovered in Asia. This time, the Cavendish finds itself prone to the strain. Since then, the strain has wiped out plantations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia and Taiwan, and it is now spreading through much of Southeast Asia. Efforts are under way to save the fruit, as it is sustaining populations across the globe. Fortunately, the area where the banana is grown in Honduras is considered the epicenter of the world's favorite supermarket banana, and South America is still a haven from Panama disease. Currently, over 100 countries grow bananas; the largest producer being India, and the largest exporter being Ecuador.

Seasons/Availability
Baby bananas are available year-round.

Current Facts
Baby banana plants are a member of the world's largest herbaceous plant bearing edible fruits, botanically known as Musa acuminate. The Baby banana is also known as the mini banana. It is trademarked by the global banana brand, Chiquita. Baby bananas were developed and marketed specifically as a snack banana for the children's consumer market. They are heavily promoted for their thin easy-to-peel peel and their unique sweetness for their size.

Nutritional Value
Baby bananas contain little to no fat and are low in calories. They are high in vitamin B6 and contain the amino acid tryptophan which helps the human body produce mood boosting serotonin. Baby bananas are high in fiber and potassium. They also posses a fair amount of phosphorous, magnesium, selenium, copper, zinc, iron and calcium. They contain vitamins A, B1, B2, C, E, K, Niacin and Pantothenic Acid.

Applications
Baby bananas are a quintessential fresh eating banana and can be used as a dessert banana as well. Their sweetness lends to many recipes in various applications. Baby bananas can be a principle ingredient in smoothies, baby food, pudding, cakes, muffins, bread, cookies, ice cream and tarts.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Native to Columbia, the Baby banana grows on a tree-size plant in bunches of “hands”. Each hand can contain anywhere from 10-12 bananas, the individual fruits are also called fingers. The bananas are harvested and shipped while still green allowing the consumer to decide their desired level of ripeness for consumption.

Geography/History
Baby bananas grow best in wet tropical conditions such as South America, the Caribbean, Asia and Africa. The plants establish themselves quickly, often producing harvest within fifteen months after planting. One of the greatest advantages of banana plants is that the herb successively produces fruit indefinitely without discrimination to seasons. The few Baby banana varieties found in the commercial marketplace are Pisang Mas, originally from Malaysia, as well as Ladyfinger and Orito. Considered a staple to many outside of the United States, it is also known as a Finger, a Ladyfinger, a Lady Finger, or a Nino banana.

Current Facts
Red currants, botanical name Ribes nrubrum, are woody shrubs within the family Grossulariaceae. They are one of over 150 species within the Ribes genus, which also includes Black currants, White currants, and gooseberry species. The word “berry” has two meanings: one based on a botanical classification, the other on the common commercial identification. Red currants, Black currants, and gooseberries are true berries because their seeds are held within the fruit, which is defined as epigynous berries.

Nutritional Value
Red currant berries are known as “superfruits” as they have naturally high antioxidant capacity due to the pigmented polyphenol, cyanidin. Medical research has proven there are medicinal properties of pigmented polyphenols, which are mainly found in the skin and seeds of berries.

Applications
Red currants can be eaten fresh, cooked or dried. They can also be frozen for long term preservation and use. Red currants' natural tart flavour and astringency is enhanced with sweetening via sugar, honey, agave nectar, and of course through cooking.

------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Blackberries are characterized by their coloring, their unique composition and their flavor. Like raspberries, Blackberries are not actually a berry, rather an aggregate fruit with individual drupelets that are held together by very fine, nearly invisible hairs. When ripe, Blackberries have a deep ink sheen with purple highlights. They are succulent and soft, with a melting quality. Their flavoring is warmly sweet, slightly tart with earthy undertones.

Seasons/Availability
Blackberries are available year-round with a peak season in summer.

Current Facts
Blackberries are a bramble fruit within the Rosaceae family along with strawberries and raspberries, and a member of the Rubus genus. There are hundreds of specific varieties of Blackberries. The name Blackberry is often used as a generic term that refers to a wide range of bush berries that are considered Blackberries. These include loganberries, boysenberries, Marionberries and ollalieberries. Anthocyanins are responsible for the dark purple pigmentation of Blackberries. In nature, the pigment is a natural attractor of the attention of animals. Animals eat the fruits and disperse the seeds, keeping the life cycle alive.

Applications
Fresh Blackberries' sweet-tart flavors and earthiness can lend itself to several applications: sweet, savory, cooked, raw, whole, mashed, pureed, muddled, preserved, even pickled. Blackberries can be utilized in savory applications alongside fresh, creamy and aged cheeses, sausages, pork, lamb and within fresh salads.

Blueberry
http://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/sppics/103.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Blueberries are delicate, petite and round. Their skin has a soft, hazy white coating, which is known as the bloom. The bloom forms a natural waterproofing and helps protect the berries from the sun and other natural elements. Blueberries have a sweet and woodsy flavor with a low acid finish when ripe.

Seasons/Availability
Blueberries are available year-round with a peak season in the summer.

Current Facts
Blueberries, botanical name Vaccinuium corymbosum, are perennial flowering plants within the genus Vacciniuma, which also includes cranberries and bilberries. There are three types of Blueberries: highbush, lowbush and hybrid half-high. The highbush Blueberry is the most commercially important of the three types. Blueberries display their deep blue coloring due to the concentration of anthocyanin present in their skin. Blueberries have the highest level of anthocyanins versus any other fruit or vegetable. Their color is an innate act of nature as blue attracts birds, which disperse the fruit's seeds, supporting future crop growth and plant survival.

Applications
Blueberries can be eaten fresh or cooked. They are a common berry used in pies, tarts, ice creams, sorbets, and jams. The can also be used in beverages, compotes, purees and gastriques. They can be dried naturally or freeze dried as well. Complimentary ingredients include cocoa, strawberries, raspberries, lavender, eucalyptus, raisins, honey, peaches, chocolate, herbs such as basil and mint, cloves, cinnamon, cream, butter, fresh cheeses, tea, sweet wines such as muscat and reisling.

Geography/History
Blueberries are native to North America. They were first cultivated in the early 20th century. Prior to that Blueberries were only found growing wild. Their cultivated success can be attributed to the agricultural specialist, Elizabeth White and American botanist Frank Coleville. Together, by 1916 they had successfully cultivated commercially valuable strains of Blueberries in Northeastern United States. The determining success factor was understanding that Blueberries need high levels of acid in their soil and that they are not self-pollinating. Today, Blueberries are the most commercially important food plant within the Vaccinium family. They grow prolifically throughout North America and more limited within Europe and the Southern hemisphere.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Artocarpus_altilis_%28fruit%29.jpg/500px-Artocarpus_altilis_%28fruit%29.jpg
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Breadfruit are round, green, and bumpy with a white fibrous pulp. When cooked, the texture and scent is like that of freshly baked bread. The taste has been compared to different things at different stages of ripeness. When small and immature -artichoke hearts; when ripe - potatoes; and when overripe and sweet - yams.

Seasons/Availability
Breadfruit is available through-out the year with short seasonal gaps.

Current Facts
The Breadfruit, known as Artocarpus Altilis, is a staple food of the South Pacific. It belongs to the Moraceae, or fig, family. The Latin name Artocarpus is derived from the Greek artos, meaning bread, and karpos, meaning fruit. Maui Brewing Company and Dogfish Head produced a limited edition craft beer in 2012 called Liquid Breadfruit, made with Breadfruit and toasted papaya seeds.

Nutritional Value
Breadfruit is high in energy from carbohydrates. It contains 70% water, is low in fat, and provides vitamin C and potassium.

Applications
Rarely eaten raw as it is very starchy, breadfruit can be steamed, boiled, roasted, fried, pickled, fermented, or frozen. The starch converts to sugar when the fruit is very ripe, making for a sweeter taste. Breadfruit can also be ground into a flour, which is gluten-free.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii has established the Breadfruit Institute, which manages the largest (120 varieties) breadfruit collection in the world. The Breadfruit Institute works with tropical NGOs to address hunger issues in those regions by exporting thousands of trees to provide sustainable food sources around the globe.

Geography/History
Breadfruit is native to the South Pacific. Captain Bligh brought it from there to the Caribbean in the late 1700s. Currently, it is grown in 90 countries. Breadfruit trees are high yield and bear fruit within 3 - 5 years. They are easy to grow and require little maintenance. Aside from the fruit, breadfruit tree wood is used in canoe-making, and the latex produced by the trees can be used as boat caulk.

------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The Cantaloupe is defined by two elements:  its roughly netted stone and green colored skin and its aromatic orange-coral colored flesh. When perfectly ripe, the flesh is juicy, unctuous and sweet. The Cantaloupe will feel heavy versus hollow, a weightiness which is an indicator of its water content. The ripe fruit releases its trademark floral musky aroma. It should yield just slightly to finger pressure at its blossom end, which is opposite of its scarred end, where it was removed from the stem. Like other melons, the Cantaloupe's flesh bears a central seed cavity. The Cantaloupe is unique to other melons in both fragrance and its flesh's texture.  Most melons simply do not have the same dense and sticky flesh that a cantaloupe does.

Seasons/Availability
Cantaloupes are available year-round.

Current Facts
While there are dozens of cultivars of Cantaloupe, there are two specific varieties recognized: the true Cantaloupe, botanically known as Cucumis melo cantalupensis, and the North American cantaloupe, Cucumis melo reticulatus. Both varieties are members of the Cucurbitaceae family, the netted variety referred to in America as a Cantaloupe is in actuality botanically speaking a muskmelon. True Cantaloupes have little or no netting and are not grown commercially outside of Europe.

Nutritional Value
Cantaloupe is an excellent source of beta-carotene, folic acid, potassium, vitamin C and dietary fiber.

Applications
The Cantaloupe can be used in fresh or raw preparations, both sweet and savory. It is not found to be suited well for cooking. Fresh Cantaloupe can be used as a breakfast fruit and as a salad ingredient. It makes a perfect element in cold or fresh desserts. It also can be used as an ingredient in drinks. Cantaloupe pairs well with feta and goat cheeses, almonds and hazelnuts, mint, citrus and cured pork. Cantaloupe's flavor is unique to all other melon varieties, making substitutes somewhat incomparable. To store, keep unripe Cantaloupes at room temperature. When ripe, refrigerate. Remove melon an hour before serving to bring out its best flavor. Cut Cantaloupe will keep refrigerated in a sealed container for three days.

Geography/History
The Cantaloupe derives its name from the Italian village of Cantalupo, where it was cultivated upon the fruit's seeds being brought there from Armenia. The original variety has had its seeds dispersed and cross-cultivated throughout Europe and the Americas. The original Cantaloupe was smaller and not quite as sweet as modern cultivars. Cantaloupes have been developed over time to achieve uniform size, improved flavor and disease resistance. This high level of consistency has contributed to the Cantaloupe becoming the most widely eaten melon variety in America today.

------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Glossy, yellow and translucent, unique star fruit's thin waxy skin has five deep lateral ridges that form charming star shapes when sliced.  Easy to recognize, it is about two to five inches in length. Pleasantly citric, the complex taste of this attractive fruit has been described as combining plum, pineapple, apple, lemon and grape when it ripens to yellow.  Its crisp texture offers a sweet-tart juice.  Narrow ribbed fruits generally have a more tart flavor; thick fleshy ribs are usually sweet.

Seasons/Availability
Star Fruit is available year-round with sporadic gaps due to adverse weather conditions affecting production.

Nutritional Value
A good source of vitamin C and potassium, star fruit provides dietary fiber. One medium size fruit contains about 40 calories.  Eating five daily servings of fruits and vegetables lowers the chances of cancer.  A recent study found that eating nine or ten daily servings of fruits and vegetables, combined with three servings of low-fat dairy products, were effective in lowering blood pressure.

Applications
Requiring no peeling or seeding, simply enjoy star fruit out of hand. Add to fruit and vegetable salads. Blend with avocado. Kiwis, mangoes and bananas welcome its tasty company. Add its goodness to enhance yogurt. Puree with other fruits or by itself for yummy Bavarian creams, ices, mousses and sherbets. For a texture and flavor balance, combine with sweet soft fruits. Sauté with shrimp. For edible garnish, sauté slices a second or two; sprinkle with sugar to glaze. Pair with fish and poultry dishes. Substitute for lemon or lime slices to garnish chilled beverages and cocktails. If green-ribbed fruit is purchased, let ripen until yellow unless a sharp tart taste is preferred. A full floral-fruity aroma is a sign it will taste its best. Keep at room temperature, turning occasionally, until its fragrant "perfume" develops.  Store at room temperature if served in a day or two. Refrigerate ripe fruit.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Growing throughout Southeast Asia, star fruit is cherished for its sweet-tart acid taste and delightful presentation.  Indonesians call it belimbing and belimbing manis; in Thailand, star fruit is called madun; and in the Philippines, it is called balimbing.

Geography/History
Native to Sri Lanka, the Moluccas, India and Indonesia, star fruit is considered to be a relatively "new" fruit and is now cultivated in the United States. Southeast Asia and Malaysia have cultivated star fruit for hundreds of years. Belonging to the wood sorrel family and of the species Averrhoa carambola, star fruit has a close relative called "belimbing". Other names include Carambola, Chinese star fruit, star apple and quite appropriately, five-angled fruit. This scented fruit was named after a twelfth century Arabic physician and philosopher, Averrhoes. Grown in Asia, South America, Central America, the Caribbean and Hawaii, trees were acquired from Hawaii and brought to the American mainland nearly one hundred years ago. Only recently has star fruit been readily available in American markets. Florida is a major producer.

Blend Cavaillon melon, yogurt, minced ginger, mint and lime together and serve chilled as a soup. To store, refrigerate and cover any cut sections.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Cavaillon, France, is regarded as the Provencal capital of the European Cantaloupe, and for which the "melon de Cavaillon" is named. From spring through late summer, Cavaillon melons are available in fresh produce markets in Provencal France. Author Alexandre Dumas donated a copy of all 194 of his works to the Cavaillon library in exchange for payment of 12 Cavaillion melons a year for the duration of his life.

Geography/History
The Cavaillon melon was cultivated from seeds brought from Cantalupo, Italy to Provence, France in the 14th century. Seeds made their way to Cavaillion via Charles VIII who brought them back from the gardens of the Popes near Rome in Cantelupo, Italy. Though the melon is grown in North America, true Cavaillon melons must grow in the Provence region to receive official Cavaillon dedication.

------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Cherimoyas are egg-shaped, globe-shaped or heart-shaped with an unusual velvety, thin skin that is light green in color. The white pulp offers a mild flavor likened to a blend of banana, vanilla, mango, papaya, pineapple and coconut. The refreshing texture is soft, smooth and melting almost custard-like, hence the name custard apple. The flesh is studded with large, black, inedible seeds. Some varieties, though not all, produce scaly depressions on their skin, where the more depressions that develop will indicate a seedier fruit.

Seasons/Availability
Cherimoya season starts in late fall and runs through winter and spring.

Current Facts
The Cherimoya, pronounced cher-uh-MOY-uh, is a subtropical fruit also known as Custard Apple or Chirimoya. Botanically classified as Annona cherimola, it is a fast-growing evergreen tree native to the mountains of Ecuador and Peru. The name "cherimoya" is derived from the Quechua (Incan) word, "chirimuya", meaning "cold seeds" as the seeds will germinate in altitudes up to six thousand feet. A new hybrid, atemoya, pronounced ah-teh-MOH-ee-yah, is a cross between the Cherimoya and the sugar apple also known as Sweetsop.

Nutritional Value
High in calories, 300 grams of fruit has about 170 calories. High in fiber, it is a good source of vitamin C and calcium, plus contains niacin and phosphorus.

Applications
Ripe Cherimoya have a delicate, sweet flavor and texture that is most apparent when eaten fresh. Cut chunks of Cherimoya and add to salads with kiwi, strawberry, papaya or other tropical fruit. Scoop flesh from skin and blend into smoothies and shakes. Add mashed pulp to yogurt or freeze with coconut milk into semifreddo. Top puff pastry with slices of Cherimoya and fresh berries, and bake into a tart. Harvest fruits when skin turns slightly yellow or pale green, or when skin gives a little to touch. To store, keep at room temperature until ripe. Wrap ripe fruit and refrigerate up to four days.

Geography/History
Cherimoya trees are native to the Andean valleys of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. Today they are commercially grown in Australia, South America, Asia, Spain, Italy, and California. They are a rather dense tree that can reach thirty feet or more in height is deciduous from February through April. In Central and South America, the trees grow wild in tropical highlands of the Andes Mountains where they thrive in the mild summer and cool nights. Flowers bloom from late winter to early summer, followed by fruit which ripen from October to May.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Black_Che.jpg/500px-Black_Che.jpg
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The perfect cherry is rounded with a slight heart shape and dimple at its stem end. The skin is thin and taut with deep red coloring. The flesh's color palate is a range of rouge tones. Its texture has a soft melting quality and its flavor bright, pleasantly tart and sweet. The only deficit is that the fruit's seed is buried in the flesh.

Seasons/Availability
Cherries are available year-round with a peak season in late spring.

Current Facts
All cherries are members of the family, Prunus and are descendents of the wild cherry, Prunus avium. They are classified as stone fruits, alongside apricots, plums, peaches and almonds. There are hundreds of cherry cultivars that have evolved naturally and have been developed to improve flavor quality, texture, ability to resist disease and to extend cherry seasons. The most common cherry cultivars are Bing and Brooks, though in the supermarket they are simply labeled 'cherries'. Farmers market varieties include early season cherries such as Sequoia and Sweetheart, cherries named for growing regions such as Tulare and of course, cherries that are named for the cherry developers themselves, such as the Lapin cherry.

Nutritional Value
Cherries contain anthocyanins, the red pigment inherently found within berries. Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that are being heavily researched for their potential health benefits, including anti-inflammation and pain reduction.

Applications
Cherries are best suited for fresh eating. They pair well with other stone fruit, especially apricots. Other favorable pairings include bacon, burrata cheese, basil, smoked and seared tuna, hazelnut oil, pine nuts, fennel, pistachios, arugula, mild lettuce greens, yogurt, vanilla ice cream and gelato, dark chocolate and berries such as blueberry and blackberry. Cherries can be used for jams or pickling. They can be preserved in maraschino liqueur which is the classic recipe for marachino cherries. Sweeter cherries are best for preserving.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
One of the most famous cherry trees is the Japanese Sakura, which is known for its bountiful spring blossoms. Picnicking under a blooming Sakura or Ume tree is a centuries old practice known as hanami. Hanami gatherings and festivals celebrate the beauty of the cherry blossom as the blossoms are a metaphor for the ephemeral nature of life. Though the Sakura trees are highly renowned for their blossoms, they do not produce fruit.

Geography/History
Cherries are native to China. First documentation of cultivation dates back to 4000 B.C. Cherries were brought through ancient trade routes into Turkey, which is known as the crossroads of Asia and Europe as it has historically been the center of major trade routes. Cherries are named after Cerasus, an agriculturally rich province in northern Turkey along the coast of the Black Sea. Cherry trees flourish in Mediterranean climates and temperate climatic zones that experience four seasons.

Clementine
http://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/sppics/5235.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The clementine is petite, bright orange in appearance with a glossy, leathery peel rich with essential oils. When punctured or zested the peel reveals bright citrus aromatics. The skin clings loosely to its segmented flesh allowing for easy peeling. Its flesh is juicy, superbly sweet and generally seedless.

Seasons/Availability
The peak season for Clementine tangerines is available during the fall and winter months.

Current Facts
The clementine mandarin, Citrus clementina, is often referenced as an Algerian tangerine. It is the most common cultivars of tangerines. There are at least fifteen known varieties of clementines. These varieties are hybrids or modified versions of the parent clementine variety. When bees cross-pollinate clementines with other fruit the fruits produce unwanted seeds.

Applications
With their balance of acidity and sweetness, the clementine tangerine is suitable for eating fresh and for use in cooked preparations. Add whole segments to cakes and salads, or juice for frozen desserts, cocktails, or vinaigrettes. Pair fresh segments with olives, honey, peppery greens, avocado, citrus and seafood. Use clementine tangerine fruit, zest and juice in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine. Clementine tangerines will keep at room temperature but should be refrigerated for longer storage.

Geography/History
The clementine tangerine is a tangerine that grows prolifically throughout the Mediterranean basin, specifically coastal citrus growing regions of Spain and North Africa. Its exposure to the United States is relatively new. It was received as budwood from Valencia, Spain in 1914. It was only in the 1990's, though that this fruit experienced large commercial-scale success. It is believed that the original clementine was discovered growing as an accidental mutation in a garden in Algeria. Testing of the Algerian tangerine and the original clementine variety proved that they are the same fruit.

Husked Coconut
http://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/sppics/943.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The brown Husked coconut is rusty brown and covered with hairy brown fibers. The thick fibrous husk of the coconut encases an inner shell and holds liquid called coconut water. There are many varieties of coconut, which are rarely differentiated once they reach the US market. There are however, three different maturation points that tend to be available: the young coconut, the white coconut and the most mature of the three, the brown Husked coconut. Offering a distinct flavor all of its own, it has a nutty almost candy-like sweetness. Look for coconuts that are heavy for their size with enough juice that you can hear an audible sloshing sound. The eyes, or indentations, should be uniformly brown and firm. The husk should be dry and without mold. Even with these signs, it is often best to buy more than one coconut as it is difficult to determine a good coconut.

Seasons/Availability
Husked coconuts are available year-round.

Nutritional Value
Fresh coconut meat provides iron, potassium, protein and 346 calories per 3.5 ounce serving. The coconut contains saturated fat, quite unusual for fruits and vegetables.

Applications
For ease in opening, puncture the eyes of the coconut with a screwdriver and drain the juice. Then heat the coconut under hot running water or place in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes. Fault lines will appear on the warmed coconut. Hold the hot coconut in a cloth and place over a large bowl. Hit the fault lines with a hammer or mallet. Save the liquid, remove the meat, and peel off brown outer pieces with a small knife. To prepare thick coconut milk, wrap grated coconut in cheesecloth and place over a bowl. Pour one-half cup warm water over and squeeze liquid into the bowl. This can be done multiple times resulting in different thickness for the milk/cream. Use the milk and meat in fruit salads, puddings, cakes, cookies, custards, pies and other baked goods. Tint grated coconut with food coloring to make a colorful sweet topping. To store, whole coconuts will keep at room temperature for two weeks. For longer storage, refrigerate. Grated coconut will keep two weeks refrigerated in a glass jar. Place a whole hot chile in with the coconut to keep it from going bad. The outer shell, or husk, of the coconut can be use used as a starter for charcoal when grilling.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
In India, coconut meat is said to be especially beneficial for pregnant women and new mothers. In Sanskrit, this palm tree is called "kalpa vriksha", meaning the "tree which provides all the necessities of life". In Brazil, the word "coco" refers to the fruit of all the varieties of the coconut palm. In Bahia, the coconut is considered one of the region's holy trinity of ingredients, joining malagueta pepper and palm oil.

Geography/History
Researchers say the first mention of the coconut was in 545 A.D. An Egyptian monk called this fruit "the great nut of India" when he visited western India and Ceylon. Marco Polo was one of the first European travelers to describe the coconut in his journals. Today coconuts flourish in tropical regions particularly along seashores. Regarded as the world's largest nut, botanists disagree just where the coconut actually began its existence. While many believe it had its beginning in the East Indies and Melanesia, some say it originated in tropical America. Considered to be the most useful tree in the world, the coconut is the fruit of Cocos nucifera. Honduras, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico are today's major growers. Malaysia, India, the Philippines, Mexico, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Papue New Guinea also produce and export coconuts.

Cranberry
http://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/sppics/210.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Cranberries are similar to olives and artichokes in the sense that each of these fruits must be altered from their raw stage to create a product that is truly palatable for human consumption. Raw Cranberries are glossy and scarlet red in appearance, firm in texture with a bitter, starchy and tart flavor. Once juiced, cooked and processed, Cranberries display the perfect sweet-tart ratio that is both quenching and nostalgically satisfying. The best fresh Cranberries are not only firm to the touch but have a bouncing quality that is actually tested during harvest. The highest quality Cranberries will bounce freely off a hardened surface.

Seasons/Availability
Fresh Cranberries have a peak season in winter.

Current Facts
Cranberries, botanically known as Vaccinium macrocarpon, are the fruit of a deep rooted evergreen shrub trailing plant of the genus, Vaccinium, the same genus that contains the blueberry plant. The Cranberry received its original name, 'Crane berry' as a result of the plant's flower abstractly resembling the head of the Sand crane, which frequented the bogs that the Cranberry plants were found growing in within Northeastern United States.

Nutritional Value
Cranberries are well known for and continue to be heavily researched for the health benefits they provide. They are loaded with antioxidants, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. They contain high levels of phytonutrients, which provide their intense red coloring. These phytonutrients are actually enhanced by sunlight exposure, thus, inadvertently the method of harvesting floating Cranberries allows the Cranberries to develop greater concentrations of the antioxidant, anthocyanin. It is important to note, Cranberries must be eaten in a non-processed form to provide the highest level of health benefits. Processing disrupts the antioxidant combination and decreases their level of synergistic benefits.

Applications
Cranberries' culinary uses are primarily as a processed fruit: dried or frozen whole, canned or processed into fruit juices and sauces. They are also synonymous with Winter menus, complimenting Holiday dishes both sweet and savory. Fresh Cranberries can be combined with other fruits or soaked in other fruit juices with sugar to lower the fruit's intense tartness. Fresh fruit can be chopped and added to salad greens, soft cheeses or it can be cooked and reduced into a cranberry sauce, chutney or jelly. Dried Cranberries can be included in salads, stuffings, breads, cookies and cakes.

Geography/History
As tradition historically suggests, the Cranberry is native to North America. Prior to any settlers arriving in America the plant was flourishing wild in acidic bogs throughout Northeastern United States and Canada. Cranberries grow wild and have been naturalized in other regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Northern Europe and Northern Asia. On a commercial scale, Cranberries are water cultivated in bogs. This allows for the buoyant berries to simply float on the water's surface for easy harvest.
