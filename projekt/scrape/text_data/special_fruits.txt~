Akebi Fruit
Description/Taste
Akebi fruit has a purple color not often seen in nature. It is the size of a russet potato and is soft to the touch. A slice can be removed from the thick rind of a domesticated Akebi fruit, whereas the wild grown fruits must be allowed to split on their own indicating ripeness. Inside of the Akebi fruit is a sweet translucent white flesh (similar in look and texture to a lychee) with a taste somewhat like pear. The flesh is filled with shiny black seeds.

Seasons/Availability
Akebi fruit is only available for two weeks out of the year; its season is at the very beginning of fall.

Current Facts
Akebi fruit is both wild and cultivated. The exotic looking fruit is found in Japan during a very brief period at the end of the summer or early fall. Because of the short availability, distribution is somewhat limited to just a few stores and in limited quantity.

Applications
The inner flesh of the Akebi fruit is usually eaten fresh, slurped from the purple pod. Seeds can be spat out or eaten; it can be difficult to remove them from the gelatinous flesh. The pod itself can be cooked and is used very much like a vegetable in traditional Tohoku cuisine. It is stuffed, sautéed and deep fried. The taste of the rind is bitter; to mellow the flavor, soak the unopened pod in water for thirty minutes to an hour.

Geography/History
Akebi fruit is native to the northern Tohoku region of Japan, and has only been cultivated and available commercially in the last few decades. Research into the Akebi fruit has found that it has antiseptic and diuretic properties.

Apricot
Description/Taste
Apricots are one of the smaller stone fruits. Their shape is rounded yet oblong. The skin is smooth and velvety, golden orange with slight rosy blushing, depending on variety. The fruit contains a loosely connected central pit. Younger apricots will be slightly firm, and somewhat sweet, yet lacking developed flavor as they ripen even after they are harvested. Ripe apricots are sweetforward with a slightly tart finish and a juicy, tender mouthfeel.

Seasons/Availability
Apricots are available in the late spring through summer.

Current Facts
The apricot, Prunus armeniaca, is a species of the genus, Prunus. It is classified as a stone fruit alongside plums, cherries, peaches, mangoes and almonds. The apricot has become the parent fruit along with plums, peaches and nectarines for dozens of successful interspecific hybrids such as pluots and apriums. Apricots are classified into three groups: Central Asian, Persia-Caucasian and European. There are dozens of different apricot cultivars that are bred for early, mid and late season ripening, superior flavor, flesh quality, coloring and even the ability to withstand long-term shipping. Popular apricot names include Blenheim, Sungold, Wilson Delicious, Hunza and Royal Rosa.

Applications
Apricots can be eaten raw, dried, pureed, roasted, grilled, baked or cooked into jams. The kernels (pit) of Central Asian varieties are also roasted and used to make apricot kernel oil. Apricots pair well with other stone fruit, including cherries, almonds and plums. They can be utilized for fresh fruit salads, for savory salads and appetizers and for desserts. Other complimentary pairings include honey, egg custards, seafood such as scallops and prawns, lavender, lemon, orange, cardamon, pistachio, cayenne, pepitas, mascarpone, burrata, chevre, vanilla, white chocolate, yogurt, hazelnut and olive oil. Apricots can be added to cakes, muffins and cookies and be made into ice cream and gelato.

Geography/History
The apricot is native to and originally discovered in the mountainous regions of north central and north western China. Trade routes, exploration and time would spread the fruit from Asia into Europe and eventually the New World. Most New World apricots are of European origins. Central Asian apricots are still relatively new to North American growers as they do not have the visual appeal of plumper European varieties yet they are considered to be the most delicious in fruit flavor and texture. Apricot trees are fairly disease resistant and do not respond well to fertilizers. Fertilizers encourage weak growth and make trees more susceptible to disease and insects. The trees love full sun, hot dry summers and sheltered cool to cold but frost-free winters. Fruits will crack under humid, wet conditions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hass Avocado
Description/Taste
The Hass avocado is known for its quintessentially tumbled leathery fairly thick skin that turns near black when fully mature. The flesh closest to the skin is a lush colored pale lime green and as it nears the central pit it develops a rich creamy yellow tone and softer, oil rich texture. Hass avocado's flavor reflects its texture - creamy and smooth with a nutty and sweet finish.

Seasons/Availability
Hass avocados' seasons vary depending on the growing region. California avocados are in season from February through October. When they are not in-season, they can be found growing in Chile, Peru and Mexico, though summer Mexican crops have a tendency to have an overly rich oil content.

Current Facts
Though there are hundreds of varieties of avocados, the Hass avocado has become the benchmark avocado for commercial production. Its long growing seasons, prolific fruit production and shipping tolerance are virtues that make the Hass the standard market avocado. It is the avocado that the general public identify as simply, an avocado. The name avocado comes from the fruits original Aztec name, aoacatl or ahuacatl. After being discovered and mispronounced by the Spanish, and then the English, the fruit made its way to Jamaica where it was called many things including avocado and alligator pear. In Florida the first avocados were introduced by the West Indies as "alligator pears" and was known as such on the eastern coast until The American Pomological Society and the U.S. Department of Agriculture adopted "avocado" as the commercial name for the fruit.

Nutritional Value
Depending on the time of year, the avocado's fat content varies. In the early part of the harvest season, California avocados have a fat content close to 2 grams per ounce, while later in the year, they can peak at 6 grams per ounce. Avocados are rich in dietary fiber, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin E, potassium and folate and are a good source of mono-unsaturated fat.

Applications
To halve and pit a ripe avocado, cut in half lengthwise until reaching the center stone. Twist the two halves in opposite directions to separate. Remove the pit with a spoon. Carefully peel away skin. Avocados may be mashed, cubed or sliced, stuffed or pureed. To store, ripen fruit at room temperature. Refrigerate when ripe. Once ripe, use promptly for optimum flavor and texture.

Geography/History
The Hass avocado is native to La Habra Heights, California where groves of avocado trees still flourish today. The very first Hass avocado tree was planted from seed (an avocado pit) in the early 1920's by A.R. Rideout. He sold a seedling to Rudolph Hass and it was that seedling that turned a single seed into a ubiquitous tree fruit. Rudolph Hass appropriately named the tree after himself and patented the fruit in 1935. The tree that launched millions more trees would bear fruit for 80 years before finally giving way to root rot, not uncommon among avocado trees. Although they need an incredible amount of water to bear healthy fruit consistently, avocado trees cannot tolerate overly irrigated soil or an abundance of rainfall.  They prefer arid regions and semi tropical regions with well aerated soil.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Florida Avocado
Description/Taste
Florida avocados are easily distinguishable from other avocados in both appearance and flavor. Unlike Hass avocados, most Florida avocado varieties' skin does not turn color when ripe. The skin is smooth, kelly green and mottled with the occasional brown streak. The skin is firmly attached to the fruit's flesh, yet easy to peel away. The flesh is cornflower gold, soft yet pliable, high in moisture content with a melting quality. The fruit has a large central pit, yet because of the fruit's size (often weighing over a pound) edible yield is still high. Its flavors display subtle notes of grass and nuts such as almonds and filberts.

Seasons/Availability
Florida avocados are available mid-summer until late winter/early spring.

Current Facts
Avocados, botanical name Persea americana, are members of the family Lauraceae, which includes the plants that produce edible cinnamon, camphor, sassafras and the herb laurel (bay leaf). The Florida avocado received its given name due to its current growing region, Florida, where there are at least 50 different varieties of avocados that grow. Avocados were first introduced into Florida via the West Indies with the moniker "alligator pears", a name no longer used today. Florida is known for and markets its larger avocado varieties that tend to produce more quality and consistent fruit. The most successful commercial varieties include Doni, Lula, Bernecker and Pollock.

Nutritional Value
Avocados have nutritional advantages over other fruit. Sustenance-wise, they contain the highest source of protein of all fruits. They are also high in fiber, folate, Vitamin E and they have 60 % more potassium than bananas per serving.

Applications
Avocados are simply suited for fresh eating or processing into a chilled soup and they serve as the principle ingredient in guacamole. Best culinary pairings include citrus, tomatoes, salt, herbs such as cilantro and basil, alliums including garlic and onions, bacon, beef, sausages, seafood, legumes, fresh, aged and blooming rind style cheeses, summer squash, cucumbers, cumin and chiles. To speed ripening, place in a paper bag and keep at room temperature. Avocados ripen within three days after harvest and should be consumed once the fruit yields to gentle pressure. Once exposed to air, the fruit's color browns, thus it is recommended to apply citrus as a preserving agent.

Geography/History
Avocados evolved as a species from animals eating the fruit and "distributing" the seeds. Avocados have been growing wild for at least 13,000 years though chosen varieties have been cultivated by humans for about 9,000 years. There are three races of avocados: Guatemalan, Mexican and West Indian. While each has distinctive features, cross-pollination permits the development of unlimited varieties. Florida avocados are native to Mexico, Central America and parts of South America. Avocados were first introduced to Florida in 1833 by Henry Perrine. Florida is credited with being the first State in America to cultivate avocados.

Bilva Fruit
Description/Taste
The immature pale green skin of the Bilva fruit becomes sunshine yellow then a mottled brown when ripe. Roughly about the size of a large orange, the outer skin of the Bilva fruit can be described as woody and hard and must be cracked open using a stone or hammer. Within the hard shell of the Bael fruit are many seeds growing in small cavities surrounded by a fibrous flesh and a fruity and aromatic, juicy pulp. Bilva fruit tastes similar to Passion fruit. When sliced and dried, the fruit resembles bicycle wheels.

Seasons/Availability
The Bilva fruit can be found growing year-round in tropical climates, with a peak season in the fall months.

Current Facts
Bilva fruit is botanically known as Aegle Marmelops, from the Bael Tree and is often called ‘Stone apple’ or Bilwa. Bilva fruit is a member of the citrus family. The tree itself is worshipped as Lord Shiva’s tree in India and its three-lobed leaves are used in the ceremonial worship of the deity. The Santhal tribes in India worship the tree as a totemic deity. Indians sometimes refer to the Bilva tree as 'the fruit of plenty' because it serves as a sustaining food as well as a medicine.

Applications
Known in Hindi as "Bel," Bilva fruit is eaten either fresh or dried. The dried fruit is crushed into a powder and used in candy, or reconstituted in water and drained in a sieve for beverages. In India a popular thirst quencher is made with Bilva fruit and jiggery, which is evaporated raw sugarcane juice.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
In Ayurvedic medicine, every part of the Bilva tree can be used for medicinal purposes. The immature Bilva fruit is roasted under mud, pureed and mixed with water and sugar or buttermilk to be used as an anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial, as well as for the treatment of digestive issues and diabetes. The fruit is also said to be good for the heart and the brain. Also called Bilwa, the tree and fruit are considered to be emblems of fertility in India.

Geography/History
The fruit, also known as Bengal Quince, is native to India and has likely existed since 2000 BC when the first of the Indian Vedas, or sacred texts, were written. Bilva trees can be found growing in and around most Shiva temples in India. The tree also grows in dry arid soil of Vietnam, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The fruit is foraged in the jungles and on the hillsides in India and is most commonly found in farmer’s markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Banana
Description/Taste
The Cavendish banana has a thick signature yellow peel when perfectly ripe, encasing an ivory cream colored, semi-starchy flesh. Depending on its age, the flavor and aromatics can vary from nuances of lemon custard to creme brulee. The banana plant is not a tree, but the world's largest herb. The fruit itself is botanically a berry.

Seasons/Availability
Bananas are available year-round.

Current Facts
The banana is the most important fruit within the global culinary landscape. Although not necessarily superior in flavor or production quality, the common banana commercially sold is known as the Cavendish banana. Due to the demise of a now-extinct variety, the Gros Michel, or "Big Mike," in the late 1960's, the Cavendish has dominated the market since the 1970's. The banana has a highly regarded culinary value as it is one of the world's most accessible and ideal foods: it is nutritious, convenient, affordable and always growing. It also turns out that each Cavendish banana growing throughout the world is a direct clone of one another, identical twins to the first one discovered in Southeast Asia, in shape, size and flavor.

Nutritional Value
Bananas are well known for their potassium rich flesh. Bananas also full of other nutrient health boosters including vitamin B, C, fiber, and magnesium. They are more calorie dense than most other fruits, making them an extremely efficient and sustainable small meal. Bananas are considered an excellent source of the amino acid tryptophan as well as vitamin B6, which in conjunction helps the body produce serotonin in the brain.

Applications
Cavendish bananas are the quintessential fresh-eating banana, but they are also considered a standard among dessert bananas. They can be utilized as an ingredient in smoothies, yogurts, cereal, cakes, muffins, breads, ice cream, cookies, pudding and more. Favorable pairings include tropical friends such pineapple, guava and mango, cinnamon and nutmeg, granola, chocolate, vanilla, stone fruits, berries, lemon and lemon zest and caramel.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Bananas are also the 4th most popular agricultural product in the world. Each year over 100 billion bananas are consumed worldwide. Americans on average eat 27 pounds of bananas per person every year. Ninety-six percent of households in America buy bananas at least once a month with 51 percent of those bananas being eaten at home for breakfast. The highest average per capita consumption of bananas in the world is in Uganda. Ugandans eat an average of 500 pounds of bananas per person every year. Bananas impact food security and income generation for more than 100 million people. Fun fact: the banana has had more songs written about it than any other fruit and bananas first appeared in written history in the 6th century B.C.

Geography/History
Cavendish bananas were first cultivated in relative obscurity in Southeast Asia. They were brought to a Caribbean botanical garden in the early part of the 20th century and put into commercial production in the 1960's. Their culinary dominance is due to their resistance to Panama disease. But in 1992, a new strain of the fungus was discovered in Asia. This time, the Cavendish finds itself prone to the strain. Since then, the strain has wiped out plantations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia and Taiwan, and it is now spreading through much of Southeast Asia. Efforts are under way to save the fruit, as it is sustaining populations across the globe. Fortunately, the area where the banana is grown in Honduras is considered the epicenter of the world's favorite supermarket banana, and South America is still a haven from Panama disease. Currently, over 100 countries grow bananas; the largest producer being India, and the largest exporter being Ecuador.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Baby Banana
Description/Taste
Baby bananas wear a thin, bright yellow signature peel. As their name suggests, they are petite in size, averaging only three to four inches in length. Baby bananas have a very dense creamy texture and once ripe their flavor is rich and sweet with vanilla and caramel undertones.

Seasons/Availability
Baby bananas are available year-round.

Current Facts
Baby banana plants are a member of the world's largest herbaceous plant bearing edible fruits, botanically known as Musa acuminate. The Baby banana is also known as the mini banana. It is trademarked by the global banana brand, Chiquita. Baby bananas were developed and marketed specifically as a snack banana for the children's consumer market. They are heavily promoted for their thin easy-to-peel peel and their unique sweetness for their size.

Nutritional Value
Baby bananas contain little to no fat and are low in calories. They are high in vitamin B6 and contain the amino acid tryptophan which helps the human body produce mood boosting serotonin. Baby bananas are high in fiber and potassium. They also posses a fair amount of phosphorous, magnesium, selenium, copper, zinc, iron and calcium. They contain vitamins A, B1, B2, C, E, K, Niacin and Pantothenic Acid.

Applications
Baby bananas are a quintessential fresh eating banana and can be used as a dessert banana as well. Their sweetness lends to many recipes in various applications. Baby bananas can be a principle ingredient in smoothies, baby food, pudding, cakes, muffins, bread, cookies, ice cream and tarts.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Native to Columbia, the Baby banana grows on a tree-size plant in bunches of “hands”. Each hand can contain anywhere from 10-12 bananas, the individual fruits are also called fingers. The bananas are harvested and shipped while still green allowing the consumer to decide their desired level of ripeness for consumption.

Geography/History
Baby bananas grow best in wet tropical conditions such as South America, the Caribbean, Asia and Africa. The plants establish themselves quickly, often producing harvest within fifteen months after planting. One of the greatest advantages of banana plants is that the herb successively produces fruit indefinitely without discrimination to seasons. The few Baby banana varieties found in the commercial marketplace are Pisang Mas, originally from Malaysia, as well as Ladyfinger and Orito. Considered a staple to many outside of the United States, it is also known as a Finger, a Ladyfinger, a Lady Finger, or a Nino banana.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Currant
Description/Taste
Musky aroma gives way to a pucker-up tartness and slight sweetness.  This tart, short-seasoned berry prefers the help of sugar and the richness of fat to bring out its best characteristics. The black currant berry is larger and has a thicker skin than other currant berry varieties. This results in a later harvest time than the red and the white currant berries.

Seasons/Availability
Black currants are available from July to August.

Current Facts
Despite their popularity in Europe, black currants are rarely seen in the United States, other than on backyard bushes, or in the liqueur crème de cassis. One must consider these berries a luxury as black currant cultivation is still banned in several states.  The crop production is so low that it isn't required to be reported to the U.S. Agricultural Department. The fruit itself will ripen from the top of the shrub on down.

Nutritional Value
Black currants are highly nutritious and full of antioxidants. They contain over three times the daily recommended intake of vitamin C.

Geography/History
European settlers brought this tart berry to America but for the better part of the last century most states banned commercial cultivation of black currants as the bushes can house a disease that can affect the growth of trees that surround them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Currant
Description/Taste
Red currant berries are pearl sized, candy apple red and somewhat translucent. Like their their black counterparts, Red currant berries have a taut thin glossy skin that encases a soft pulpy flesh which contains small edible seeds. When the berries' skin is pierced the fruit explodes with bright fruity aromatics and a tart piquant flavor.

Seasons/Availability
Red currants are available late spring through the early winter months. Red currants are also available from South America in winter.

Current Facts
Red currants, botanical name Ribes nrubrum, are woody shrubs within the family Grossulariaceae. They are one of over 150 species within the Ribes genus, which also includes Black currants, White currants, and gooseberry species. The word “berry” has two meanings: one based on a botanical classification, the other on the common commercial identification. Red currants, Black currants, and gooseberries are true berries because their seeds are held within the fruit, which is defined as epigynous berries.

Nutritional Value
Red currant berries are known as “superfruits” as they have naturally high antioxidant capacity due to the pigmented polyphenol, cyanidin. Medical research has proven there are medicinal properties of pigmented polyphenols, which are mainly found in the skin and seeds of berries.

Applications
Red currants can be eaten fresh, cooked or dried. They can also be frozen for long term preservation and use. Red currants' natural tart flavour and astringency is enhanced with sweetening via sugar, honey, agave nectar, and of course through cooking. Red currants  add flavor and texture to sauces, liqueurs, jams, jellies and syrups. Complimentary pairings include baking spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg, vanilla, cream, clove, citrus fruits, tomatoes, juniper, ginger, strawberries, huckleberries, stone fruit such as peaches and cherries, lemon verbena, game meats, pork, shellfish, grilled steak and herbs such as basil and mint.

Geography/History
All cultivated currant species have Asian and European ancestry. The most significant historical source of cultivation of currants was within Russia during the 11th century when they were grown in monastery gardens, towns and settlements. Red currant plants grow wild and they are cultivated both commercially and domestically for their berries. Red currants grow in many climates within the Northern hemisphere and they are able to flourish in moist to wet, well-drained soil and once established they need little irrigation to survive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blackberry
Description/Taste
Blackberries are characterized by their coloring, their unique composition and their flavor. Like raspberries, Blackberries are not actually a berry, rather an aggregate fruit with individual drupelets that are held together by very fine, nearly invisible hairs. When ripe, Blackberries have a deep ink sheen with purple highlights. They are succulent and soft, with a melting quality. Their flavoring is warmly sweet, slightly tart with earthy undertones.

Seasons/Availability
Blackberries are available year-round with a peak season in summer.

Current Facts
Blackberries are a bramble fruit within the Rosaceae family along with strawberries and raspberries, and a member of the Rubus genus. There are hundreds of specific varieties of Blackberries. The name Blackberry is often used as a generic term that refers to a wide range of bush berries that are considered Blackberries. These include loganberries, boysenberries, Marionberries and ollalieberries. Anthocyanins are responsible for the dark purple pigmentation of Blackberries. In nature, the pigment is a natural attractor of the attention of animals. Animals eat the fruits and disperse the seeds, keeping the life cycle alive.

Applications
Fresh Blackberries' sweet-tart flavors and earthiness can lend itself to several applications: sweet, savory, cooked, raw, whole, mashed, pureed, muddled, preserved, even pickled. Blackberries can be utilized in savory applications alongside fresh, creamy and aged cheeses, sausages, pork, lamb and within fresh salads. Complimentary ingredients include pistachios, pine nuts, almonds, other bramble berries, aged balsamic vinegar, salad greens such as butter lettuce and arugula, apples, fresh and dried figs, fennel, bacon and basil.

Geography/History
Blackberries are considered to be the most taxonomically complex of any fruit crop. It is native to both the New and Old world. Blackberries are native to Asia, Europe, North and South America. The species, Rubus ursinus is native to the Pacific Northwest, and it has produced a long lineage of commercial cultivars grown in North America. In Europe, there are six species that are referred to as the aggregate species Rubus fruticosus. Blackberries are cultivated throughout the world, yet they are also considered an invasive species in some regions as their roots run deep, clinging to the earth, while strangling any roots in their path.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue Crown Fruit
Description/Taste
Blue Crown fruit is egg-shaped, roughly two inches in diameter with a yellow to orange outer skin when ripe. The inner off-white flesh has small red edible seeds with a subtle sweet and peppery flavor. The flavor is somewhat blackberry-like.

Seasons/Availability
Blue Crown fruit is available during the late summer months.

Current Facts
Blue Crown fruit is commonly referred to as Blue passion flower and is botanically known as Passiflora caerulea. The fruit may take a back seat to the stunning flower that appears before the fruit mature and ripen. The flower has attracted admirers throughout time and was named “passion flower” by 16th century missionaries in South America, saying the symbolized the death of Christ.

Applications
Blue Crown fruit is a passionfruit and can be eaten as such and used in the same preparations. The inner seeds can be scooped from within, along with the flesh. Seeds can be removed by pushing the passionfruit pulp through cheesecloth and the contents can be used for ice cream, beverages, purees, dressings, etc.

Geography/History
Blue Crown fruit is native to the southern countries of South America and is known as Mburucuyá in parts of Paraguay. The tree is very hardy and can handle very low temperatures; it is evergreen in mild climates and can grow back from roots in areas of severe cold. The plant is grown in the southwestern US.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blueberry
Description/Taste
Blueberries are delicate, petite and round. Their skin has a soft, hazy white coating, which is known as the bloom. The bloom forms a natural waterproofing and helps protect the berries from the sun and other natural elements. Blueberries have a sweet and woodsy flavor with a low acid finish when ripe.

Seasons/Availability
Blueberries are available year-round with a peak season in the summer.

Current Facts
Blueberries, botanical name Vaccinuium corymbosum, are perennial flowering plants within the genus Vacciniuma, which also includes cranberries and bilberries. There are three types of Blueberries: highbush, lowbush and hybrid half-high. The highbush Blueberry is the most commercially important of the three types. Blueberries display their deep blue coloring due to the concentration of anthocyanin present in their skin. Blueberries have the highest level of anthocyanins versus any other fruit or vegetable. Their color is an innate act of nature as blue attracts birds, which disperse the fruit's seeds, supporting future crop growth and plant survival.

Applications
Blueberries can be eaten fresh or cooked. They are a common berry used in pies, tarts, ice creams, sorbets, and jams. The can also be used in beverages, compotes, purees and gastriques. They can be dried naturally or freeze dried as well. Complimentary ingredients include cocoa, strawberries, raspberries, lavender, eucalyptus, raisins, honey, peaches, chocolate, herbs such as basil and mint, cloves, cinnamon, cream, butter, fresh cheeses, tea, sweet wines such as muscat and reisling.

Geography/History
Blueberries are native to North America. They were first cultivated in the early 20th century. Prior to that Blueberries were only found growing wild. Their cultivated success can be attributed to the agricultural specialist, Elizabeth White and American botanist Frank Coleville. Together, by 1916 they had successfully cultivated commercially valuable strains of Blueberries in Northeastern United States. The determining success factor was understanding that Blueberries need high levels of acid in their soil and that they are not self-pollinating. Today, Blueberries are the most commercially important food plant within the Vaccinium family. They grow prolifically throughout North America and more limited within Europe and the Southern hemisphere.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Breadfruit
Description/Taste
Breadfruit are round, green, and bumpy with a white fibrous pulp. When cooked, the texture and scent is like that of freshly baked bread. The taste has been compared to different things at different stages of ripeness. When small and immature -artichoke hearts; when ripe - potatoes; and when overripe and sweet - yams.

Seasons/Availability
Breadfruit is available through-out the year with short seasonal gaps.

Current Facts
The Breadfruit, known as Artocarpus Altilis, is a staple food of the South Pacific. It belongs to the Moraceae, or fig, family. The Latin name Artocarpus is derived from the Greek artos, meaning bread, and karpos, meaning fruit. Maui Brewing Company and Dogfish Head produced a limited edition craft beer in 2012 called Liquid Breadfruit, made with Breadfruit and toasted papaya seeds.

Nutritional Value
Breadfruit is high in energy from carbohydrates. It contains 70% water, is low in fat, and provides vitamin C and potassium.

Applications
Rarely eaten raw as it is very starchy, breadfruit can be steamed, boiled, roasted, fried, pickled, fermented, or frozen. The starch converts to sugar when the fruit is very ripe, making for a sweeter taste. Breadfruit can also be ground into a flour, which is gluten-free.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii has established the Breadfruit Institute, which manages the largest (120 varieties) breadfruit collection in the world. The Breadfruit Institute works with tropical NGOs to address hunger issues in those regions by exporting thousands of trees to provide sustainable food sources around the globe.

Geography/History
Breadfruit is native to the South Pacific. Captain Bligh brought it from there to the Caribbean in the late 1700s. Currently, it is grown in 90 countries. Breadfruit trees are high yield and bear fruit within 3 - 5 years. They are easy to grow and require little maintenance. Aside from the fruit, breadfruit tree wood is used in canoe-making, and the latex produced by the trees can be used as boat caulk.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cantaloupe
Description/Taste
The Cantaloupe is defined by two elements:  its roughly netted stone and green colored skin and its aromatic orange-coral colored flesh. When perfectly ripe, the flesh is juicy, unctuous and sweet. The Cantaloupe will feel heavy versus hollow, a weightiness which is an indicator of its water content. The ripe fruit releases its trademark floral musky aroma. It should yield just slightly to finger pressure at its blossom end, which is opposite of its scarred end, where it was removed from the stem. Like other melons, the Cantaloupe's flesh bears a central seed cavity. The Cantaloupe is unique to other melons in both fragrance and its flesh's texture.  Most melons simply do not have the same dense and sticky flesh that a cantaloupe does.

Seasons/Availability
Cantaloupes are available year-round.

Current Facts
While there are dozens of cultivars of Cantaloupe, there are two specific varieties recognized: the true Cantaloupe, botanically known as Cucumis melo cantalupensis, and the North American cantaloupe, Cucumis melo reticulatus. Both varieties are members of the Cucurbitaceae family, the netted variety referred to in America as a Cantaloupe is in actuality botanically speaking a muskmelon. True Cantaloupes have little or no netting and are not grown commercially outside of Europe.

Nutritional Value
Cantaloupe is an excellent source of beta-carotene, folic acid, potassium, vitamin C and dietary fiber.

Applications
The Cantaloupe can be used in fresh or raw preparations, both sweet and savory. It is not found to be suited well for cooking. Fresh Cantaloupe can be used as a breakfast fruit and as a salad ingredient. It makes a perfect element in cold or fresh desserts. It also can be used as an ingredient in drinks. Cantaloupe pairs well with feta and goat cheeses, almonds and hazelnuts, mint, citrus and cured pork. Cantaloupe's flavor is unique to all other melon varieties, making substitutes somewhat incomparable. To store, keep unripe Cantaloupes at room temperature. When ripe, refrigerate. Remove melon an hour before serving to bring out its best flavor. Cut Cantaloupe will keep refrigerated in a sealed container for three days.

Geography/History
The Cantaloupe derives its name from the Italian village of Cantalupo, where it was cultivated upon the fruit's seeds being brought there from Armenia. The original variety has had its seeds dispersed and cross-cultivated throughout Europe and the Americas. The original Cantaloupe was smaller and not quite as sweet as modern cultivars. Cantaloupes have been developed over time to achieve uniform size, improved flavor and disease resistance. This high level of consistency has contributed to the Cantaloupe becoming the most widely eaten melon variety in America today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Star Fruit
Description/Taste
Glossy, yellow and translucent, unique star fruit's thin waxy skin has five deep lateral ridges that form charming star shapes when sliced.  Easy to recognize, it is about two to five inches in length. Pleasantly citric, the complex taste of this attractive fruit has been described as combining plum, pineapple, apple, lemon and grape when it ripens to yellow.  Its crisp texture offers a sweet-tart juice.  Narrow ribbed fruits generally have a more tart flavor; thick fleshy ribs are usually sweet.

Seasons/Availability
Star Fruit is available year-round with sporadic gaps due to adverse weather conditions affecting production.

Nutritional Value
A good source of vitamin C and potassium, star fruit provides dietary fiber. One medium size fruit contains about 40 calories.  Eating five daily servings of fruits and vegetables lowers the chances of cancer.  A recent study found that eating nine or ten daily servings of fruits and vegetables, combined with three servings of low-fat dairy products, were effective in lowering blood pressure.

Applications
Requiring no peeling or seeding, simply enjoy star fruit out of hand. Add to fruit and vegetable salads. Blend with avocado. Kiwis, mangoes and bananas welcome its tasty company. Add its goodness to enhance yogurt. Puree with other fruits or by itself for yummy Bavarian creams, ices, mousses and sherbets. For a texture and flavor balance, combine with sweet soft fruits. Sauté with shrimp. For edible garnish, sauté slices a second or two; sprinkle with sugar to glaze. Pair with fish and poultry dishes. Substitute for lemon or lime slices to garnish chilled beverages and cocktails. If green-ribbed fruit is purchased, let ripen until yellow unless a sharp tart taste is preferred. A full floral-fruity aroma is a sign it will taste its best. Keep at room temperature, turning occasionally, until its fragrant "perfume" develops.  Store at room temperature if served in a day or two. Refrigerate ripe fruit.

Growing throughout Southeast Asia, star fruit is cherished for its sweet-tart acid taste and delightful presentation.  Indonesians call it belimbing and belimbing manis; in Thailand, star fruit is called madun; and in the Philippines, it is called balimbing.

Geography/History
Native to Sri Lanka, the Moluccas, India and Indonesia, star fruit is considered to be a relatively "new" fruit and is now cultivated in the United States. Southeast Asia and Malaysia have cultivated star fruit for hundreds of years. Belonging to the wood sorrel family and of the species Averrhoa carambola, star fruit has a close relative called "belimbing". Other names include Carambola, Chinese star fruit, star apple and quite appropriately, five-angled fruit. This scented fruit was named after a twelfth century Arabic physician and philosopher, Averrhoes. Grown in Asia, South America, Central America, the Caribbean and Hawaii, trees were acquired from Hawaii and brought to the American mainland nearly one hundred years ago. Only recently has star fruit been readily available in American markets. Florida is a major producer.

Cherimoya
Description/Taste
Cherimoyas are egg-shaped, globe-shaped or heart-shaped with an unusual velvety, thin skin that is light green in color. The white pulp offers a mild flavor likened to a blend of banana, vanilla, mango, papaya, pineapple and coconut. The refreshing texture is soft, smooth and melting almost custard-like, hence the name custard apple. The flesh is studded with large, black, inedible seeds. Some varieties, though not all, produce scaly depressions on their skin, where the more depressions that develop will indicate a seedier fruit.

Seasons/Availability
Cherimoya season starts in late fall and runs through winter and spring.

Current Facts
The Cherimoya, pronounced cher-uh-MOY-uh, is a subtropical fruit also known as Custard Apple or Chirimoya. Botanically classified as Annona cherimola, it is a fast-growing evergreen tree native to the mountains of Ecuador and Peru. The name "cherimoya" is derived from the Quechua (Incan) word, "chirimuya", meaning "cold seeds" as the seeds will germinate in altitudes up to six thousand feet. A new hybrid, atemoya, pronounced ah-teh-MOH-ee-yah, is a cross between the Cherimoya and the sugar apple also known as Sweetsop.

Nutritional Value
High in calories, 300 grams of fruit has about 170 calories. High in fiber, it is a good source of vitamin C and calcium, plus contains niacin and phosphorus.

Cherry
Description/Taste
The perfect cherry is rounded with a slight heart shape and dimple at its stem end. The skin is thin and taut with deep red coloring. The flesh's color palate is a range of rouge tones. Its texture has a soft melting quality and its flavor bright, pleasantly tart and sweet. The only deficit is that the fruit's seed is buried in the flesh.

Seasons/Availability
Cherries are available year-round with a peak season in late spring.

Current Facts
All cherries are members of the family, Prunus and are descendents of the wild cherry, Prunus avium. They are classified as stone fruits, alongside apricots, plums, peaches and almonds. There are hundreds of cherry cultivars that have evolved naturally and have been developed to improve flavor quality, texture, ability to resist disease and to extend cherry seasons. The most common cherry cultivars are Bing and Brooks, though in the supermarket they are simply labeled 'cherries'. Farmers market varieties include early season cherries such as Sequoia and Sweetheart, cherries named for growing regions such as Tulare and of course, cherries that are named for the cherry developers themselves, such as the Lapin cherry.

Nutritional Value
Cherries contain anthocyanins, the red pigment inherently found within berries. Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that are being heavily researched for their potential health benefits, including anti-inflammation and pain reduction.

Applications
Cherries are best suited for fresh eating. They pair well with other stone fruit, especially apricots. Other favorable pairings include bacon, burrata cheese, basil, smoked and seared tuna, hazelnut oil, pine nuts, fennel, pistachios, arugula, mild lettuce greens, yogurt, vanilla ice cream and gelato, dark chocolate and berries such as blueberry and blackberry. Cherries can be used for jams or pickling. They can be preserved in maraschino liqueur which is the classic recipe for marachino cherries. Sweeter cherries are best for preserving.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
One of the most famous cherry trees is the Japanese Sakura, which is known for its bountiful spring blossoms. Picnicking under a blooming Sakura or Ume tree is a centuries old practice known as hanami. Hanami gatherings and festivals celebrate the beauty of the cherry blossom as the blossoms are a metaphor for the ephemeral nature of life. Though the Sakura trees are highly renowned for their blossoms, they do not produce fruit.

Geography/History
Cherries are native to China. First documentation of cultivation dates back to 4000 B.C. Cherries were brought through ancient trade routes into Turkey, which is known as the crossroads of Asia and Europe as it has historically been the center of major trade routes. Cherries are named after Cerasus, an agriculturally rich province in northern Turkey along the coast of the Black Sea. Cherry trees flourish in Mediterranean climates and temperate climatic zones that experience four seasons.

Seasons/Availability
The peak season for Clementine tangerines is late fall into mid-winter.

Current Facts
The Clementine tangerine, Citrus clementina, is often referenced as an Algerian tangerine. It is the most common cultivars of tangerines. There are at least fifteen known varieties of clementines. These varieties are hybrids or modified versions of the parent Clementine variety. When bees cross-pollinate clementines with other fruit the fruits produce unwanted seeds.

Applications
With their balance of acidity and sweetness, the Clementine tangerine is suitable for eating fresh and for use in cooked preparations. Add whole segments to cakes and salads, or juice for frozen desserts, cocktails, or vinaigrettes. Pair fresh segments with olives, honey, peppery greens, avocado, citrus and seafood. Use Clementine tangerine fruit, zest and juice in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine. Clementine tangerines will keep at room temperature but should be refrigerated for longer storage.

Geography/History
The Clementine tangerine is a tangerine that grows prolifically throughout the Mediterranean basin, specifically coastal citrus growing regions of Spain and North Africa. Its exposure to the United States is relatively new. It was received as budwood from Valencia, Spain in 1914. It was only in the 1990's, though that this fruit experienced large commercial-scale success. It is believed that the original Clementine was discovered growing as an accidental mutation in a garden in Algeria. Testing of the Algerian tangerine and the original Clementine variety proved that they are the same fruit.

Husked Coconut
Description/Taste
The brown Husked coconut is rusty brown and covered with hairy brown fibers. The thick fibrous husk of the coconut encases an inner shell and holds liquid called coconut water. There are many varieties of coconut, which are rarely differentiated once they reach the US market. There are however, three different maturation points that tend to be available: the young coconut, the white coconut and the most mature of the three, the brown Husked coconut. Offering a distinct flavor all of its own, it has a nutty almost candy-like sweetness. Look for coconuts that are heavy for their size with enough juice that you can hear an audible sloshing sound. The eyes, or indentations, should be uniformly brown and firm. The husk should be dry and without mold. Even with these signs, it is often best to buy more than one coconut as it is difficult to determine a good coconut.

Seasons/Availability
Husked coconuts are available year-round.

Nutritional Value
Fresh coconut meat provides iron, potassium, protein and 346 calories per 3.5 ounce serving. The coconut contains saturated fat, quite unusual for fruits and vegetables.

Applications
For ease in opening, puncture the eyes of the coconut with a screwdriver and drain the juice. Then heat the coconut under hot running water or place in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes. Fault lines will appear on the warmed coconut. Hold the hot coconut in a cloth and place over a large bowl. Hit the fault lines with a hammer or mallet. Save the liquid, remove the meat, and peel off brown outer pieces with a small knife. To prepare thick coconut milk, wrap grated coconut in cheesecloth and place over a bowl. Pour one-half cup warm water over and squeeze liquid into the bowl. This can be done multiple times resulting in different thickness for the milk/cream. Use the milk and meat in fruit salads, puddings, cakes, cookies, custards, pies and other baked goods. Tint grated coconut with food coloring to make a colorful sweet topping. To store, whole coconuts will keep at room temperature for two weeks. For longer storage, refrigerate. Grated coconut will keep two weeks refrigerated in a glass jar. Place a whole hot chile in with the coconut to keep it from going bad. The outer shell, or husk, of the coconut can be use used as a starter for charcoal when grilling.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
In India, coconut meat is said to be especially beneficial for pregnant women and new mothers. In Sanskrit, this palm tree is called "kalpa vriksha", meaning the "tree which provides all the necessities of life". In Brazil, the word "coco" refers to the fruit of all the varieties of the coconut palm. In Bahia, the coconut is considered one of the region's holy trinity of ingredients, joining malagueta pepper and palm oil.

Geography/History
Researchers say the first mention of the coconut was in 545 A.D. An Egyptian monk called this fruit "the great nut of India" when he visited western India and Ceylon. Marco Polo was one of the first European travelers to describe the coconut in his journals. Today coconuts flourish in tropical regions particularly along seashores. Regarded as the world's largest nut, botanists disagree just where the coconut actually began its existence. While many believe it had its beginning in the East Indies and Melanesia, some say it originated in tropical America. Considered to be the most useful tree in the world, the coconut is the fruit of Cocos nucifera. Honduras, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico are today's major growers. Malaysia, India, the Philippines, Mexico, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Papue New Guinea also produce and export coconuts.

Cranberry
Description/Taste
Cranberries are similar to olives and artichokes in the sense that each of these fruits must be altered from their raw stage to create a product that is truly palatable for human consumption. Raw Cranberries are glossy and scarlet red in appearance, firm in texture with a bitter, starchy and tart flavor. Once juiced, cooked and processed, Cranberries display the perfect sweet-tart ratio that is both quenching and nostalgically satisfying. The best fresh Cranberries are not only firm to the touch but have a bouncing quality that is actually tested during harvest. The highest quality Cranberries will bounce freely off a hardened surface.

Seasons/Availability
Fresh Cranberries have a peak season in winter.

Current Facts
Cranberries, botanically known as Vaccinium macrocarpon, are the fruit of a deep rooted evergreen shrub trailing plant of the genus, Vaccinium, the same genus that contains the blueberry plant. The Cranberry received its original name, 'Crane berry' as a result of the plant's flower abstractly resembling the head of the Sand crane, which frequented the bogs that the Cranberry plants were found growing in within Northeastern United States.

Nutritional Value
Cranberries are well known for and continue to be heavily researched for the health benefits they provide. They are loaded with antioxidants, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. They contain high levels of phytonutrients, which provide their intense red coloring. These phytonutrients are actually enhanced by sunlight exposure, thus, inadvertently the method of harvesting floating Cranberries allows the Cranberries to develop greater concentrations of the antioxidant, anthocyanin. It is important to note, Cranberries must be eaten in a non-processed form to provide the highest level of health benefits. Processing disrupts the antioxidant combination and decreases their level of synergistic benefits.

Applications
Cranberries' culinary uses are primarily as a processed fruit: dried or frozen whole, canned or processed into fruit juices and sauces. They are also synonymous with Winter menus, complimenting Holiday dishes both sweet and savory. Fresh Cranberries can be combined with other fruits or soaked in other fruit juices with sugar to lower the fruit's intense tartness. Fresh fruit can be chopped and added to salad greens, soft cheeses or it can be cooked and reduced into a cranberry sauce, chutney or jelly. Dried Cranberries can be included in salads, stuffings, breads, cookies and cakes.

Geography/History
As tradition historically suggests, the Cranberry is native to North America. Prior to any settlers arriving in America the plant was flourishing wild in acidic bogs throughout Northeastern United States and Canada. Cranberries grow wild and have been naturalized in other regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Northern Europe and Northern Asia. On a commercial scale, Cranberries are water cultivated in bogs. This allows for the buoyant berries to simply float on the water's surface for easy harvest.

Nutritional Value
Acai berries are high in anti-oxidants and fiber.  When acai first entered the U.S. market, it was marketed as a "superfood" but many of those claims have since been challenged.

Applications
Acai juice is often used in smoothies.  Acai pulp is used for the popular "acai bowls" served for breakfast.  It is also used in sorbets.  Acai powder is often used in topical skin creams.

Date
Description/Taste
Attached to their thin spindly vine, dates are actually a berry with a ridged seed and are the fruit of the date palm tree. There are two types of dates, soft and semi-soft. The soft date has high moisture content, low sugar content and has a soft flesh. The semi-soft date has high sugar content, relatively low moisture content and a firmer texture. The semi-soft Deglet Noor, meaning "date of light" is medium to large, amber and oblong and accounts for eight-five percent of the dates grown in California. The Zahidi, meaning "nobility" is a smaller semi-soft date, golden in color and egg-shaped. Soft varieties of dates include the Medjool, meaning "unknown", the Khadrawy, meaning "green" and the Halawy, meaning "sweet". Dates offer a sweet taste with a rather sticky thick texture, often compared to the texture of the sugar cane.

Seasons/Availability
Dates on the vine are available during mid to late summer.

Current Facts
Date palms located in the Coachella Valley of southern California in the vicinity of Indio and Palm Springs produce almost the entire supply of the country's dates. Date palms can live and bear fruit for one hundred years and may grow one hundred feet tall. Three hundred pounds of dates can be produced by just one healthy palm in a season.

Nutritional Value
Rich in folic acid and fiber, one average date contains about 24 calories. Dates contain no sodium or fat.

Applications
Dates make delicious fillings, especially for traditional date-filled cookies and are a popular ingredient for many other baked goods and pastries.

Tightly wrapped semi-soft dates may be kept at room temperature but will keep longer if refrigerated.  Dates will stay moist for as long as eight months if stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The word "date" comes from the Latin word "dactylus" meaning "finger" as the date was thought to resemble one.Chinese cuisine especially uses dates in their pastries and in their steamed sweet buns. The date is known as hoan jo in China and in India it is also called chawara and khajur.

Geography/History
Evidence shows date palms grew along the Nile in the fifth century B.C. Nomadic tribes are said to have taken the date palm to the Sahara about two thousand years ago. The Moors are credited with its introduction into Spain and North Africa. Spanish missionaries attempted to grow the trees along the coast of California but the moist climate wasn't suitable. The dry desert climate at Mecca, California proved to be an ideal growing area and the trees that were planted there in 1900, flourished. By 1915, the California date industry was off to a very good beginning. Thirty varieties of dates now exist with most having Arabic names.

Durian is rich in sugar, carbohydrates, fatty acids and protein; it is high in nutrients, particularly sulfer. Durian also contains Vitamin C and is rich in antioxidants specifically flavonoids, beta-carotene and anthocyanins. When compared to unripe and overripe Durian the ripe Durian offers the highest antioxidant content.

Applications
Durian fruit is well-suited to preparations where the flesh is pureed or blended. The large, fleshy seeds may be roasted or boiled and eaten as nuts. Use the flesh in batters for cakes and baked goods, custards, purees and ice creams. Pair with other tropical fruit such as mangosteen and mango, or alongside sticky rice or coconut cream. Wear protective gloves when slicing and removing the edible pods from the spiky skinned fruit. For best flavor and quality use within one week.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Outside of Asian communities, Durian is a relatively unknown fruit in America. Exposure to the food community via media exploitation has attributed to its cult status.

Geography/History
The Durian tree is native to Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia and may have originated in Gua Musang in the Kelantan state of Malaysia. It prefers highly tropical climates near sea level and has thus been naturalized in other Southeast Asia and Far East countries, including Thailand, Sri Lanka, Singapore and the Polynesian Islands. Though Durian can be found in many local markets in the countries in which it is harvested, the fruit is shipped internationally only from Thailand and Indonesia, where it is grown for commercial production.

Egg Fruit
Description/Taste
The Egg Fruit tree is approximately 8 meters tall and bears oblong fruits that range from 7-12 centimeters in length. The fruits can vary in shape, some with a straight pointed end others curved at the tip. When ripe, the Egg Fruit turns a golden-orange color and occasionally exhibits rusty brown blotches, which is no indication of the inner flesh’s quality. The interior is both the color and texture of a hard-boiled egg yolk, and contains 1 to 4 hard black seeds. Some people find the strong musky aroma of ripe Egg Fruit to be offensive. Its flavor is rich with a mellow sweetness like that of roasted pumpkin or sweet potato.

Seasons/Availability
Egg Fruit is available in fall into summer in tropical climates.

Current Facts
Egg Fruit is commonly referred to as Canistel and botanically classified as Pouteria campechiana. It is a member of the Sapotaceae Family and a close relative of the more popular tropical fruit, Sapota. Egg Fruit gets its name from the consistency of its flesh, which when ripe is said to resemble that of a hard-boiled egg yolk, but with the flavors of a roasted sweet potato.

Nutritional Value
Egg fruit is rich in niacin, iron, calcium, beta-carotene and ascorbic acid.

Applications
Egg Fruit is often eaten raw as a simple snack with a sprinkling of salt and lemon juice. It is usually used in sweet baking applications as a pumpkin-like ingredient. The pureed flesh may be added into custards, ice creams, bread, pancakes, smoothies, milk shakes or made into jams and marmalades. The Egg Fruit is a central ingredient in recipes for vegan cheesecake, eggnog, deviled eggs and even cheese. Complimentary flavors include: allspice, cinnamon, ginger, thyme, turmeric, orange, maple syrup, pecans, walnuts, almond, coconut and vanilla.

Geography/History
The Egg Fruit is native to southern North America and northern Central America, including the countries of Mexico, El Salvador, Belize and Guatemala. It has since been naturalized throughout the world in Tropical and Subtropical climates. The trees thrive with moderate precipitation, but can also do well in regions of prolonged dry seasons.

Elderberry
Description/Taste
Elderberries are tapioca pearl-sized purple berries that grow in clusters. The fruits have an appearance of micro-sized blueberries, though, unlike a blueberry, their flavors are not mellow nor sweet. The Elderberry has the distinctly tart and acidic flavor of a wild berry, perhaps an inherent defense mechanism. Although the fruit can be eaten raw, cooking elderberries mellows the fruit's flavor and has been the singular method used to make this tart fruit more palatable.

Seasons/Availability
The Elderberry is available during late summer into early fall.

Current Facts
Elderberry, scientific name, Sambucus canadensis, commonly known as the American Elder, is a partially self-fruiting bush berry plant that is considered poisonous, though its toxicity levels are considered low if eaten. Unripe berries and foliage are specifically considered toxic, though if cooked all toxic compounds are eliminated. As elderberries are generally a wild fruit plant, little cultivation or breeding has been done to improve the plant, though there are a handful of different cultivars to choose from for home gardening. Most elderberry plants are grown for ornamental and edible landscape use. Commercially, elderberries are used as a jam and the flowers of the plant are utilized for infusing alcohol to create liqueur and wine.

Nutritional Value
Elderberries have high levels of Vitamin C.  In extract form, the elderberry has been proven effective in fighting Avian flu as it is rich in antioxidants that support the body's immune system and fight free radicals.

Applications
Elderberries are best suited for cooked and processed applications as they bring out their best culinary attributes. Complimentary companion ingredients include brown sugar, dates, dried figs, maple syrup, fresh bramble berries, fresh and cooked stone fruits, roasted nuts, foie gras, scallops, vanilla, white wines, tawny ports, coffee and chocolate.

Geography/History
The Elderberry plant is native to North America. Plants grow wild from Northern Mexico to British Columbia. They thrive in moist soil along stream banks, river banks, in slopes and canyons or in openings within forest habitats with warm sunny days. Although, the raw plant is considered poisonous to ingest as humans, the elderberry plant serves as food for the wild, including birds, squirrels, elk, deer and bears. It is also planted as agricultural cover crop and food for livestock, including goats, sheep and cattle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feijoa
Description/Taste
Feijoas fruits are ellipsoid shaped, similar to an egg. The color and texture of the skin both resemble that of a lime. The fruit has distinctive aromatics both sweet and tart and suggestive of its tropical flavors. The flesh is dense, grainy and creamy, similar to the flesh of a ripe pear. The flesh contains a jelly-like seed cavity. Its flavors are a melange of quince, pineapple, banana and sweet grapes. The entire fruit is edible.

Seasons/Availability
Feijoas are available late early fall through spring.

Current Facts
Feijoas, AKA Pineapple Guava and Guavasteen, scientific name Acca sellowianas, is a member of the Myrtaceae (myrtle) family along with guava, solve and eucalyptus. Fiejoas is the common name given to dozens of cultivars, which will share similar characteristics but also distinguish themselves from one another by size, aromatics, flavor, ripening times, and even coloring.

Applications
Feijoas find themselves typically being classified as a dessert ingredient or as simply being eaten fresh out of hand. They are very suited to salad and savory recipes though and have many companion ingredients. Feijoas can be baked, sautéed, caramelized and pureed, preserved and jammed. They can be paired with cheeses such as aged cheddars, papaya, citruses, cream, hazelnuts, pears, duck, pork, fish and chicken. Feijoas are a perfect dessert ingredient in ice creams, gelatos, sorbets, baked goods, panna cotta and custards. Flavor enhancers include sugar, cumin, cinnamon, honey, ginger, pineapple, vanilla, white wine, chile and nutmeg.

Geography/History
The Feijoa is native to South America, specifically extreme southernmost Brazil, Argentina and mountainous regions of Uruguay. The Feijoa was collected in southern Brazil by a German explorer Friedrich Sellow in 1815. Though he was not the fruit's discover, the Fiejoas was named after Brazilian botanist, Don da Silva Feijo. Feijoas thrive in cool subtropical climates with low humidity. Feijoas are cultivated in South America, New Zealand, Australia, Asia, Africa and the United States.

Green Fig
Description/Taste
Green figs are generally larger and plumper than black figs. When ripe, the figs will be pale lime green with pink to brown variegation that start from the shoulders. The weight of the fig is in direct correlation with its ripeness and sugar content. A heavy fig is a good sign that it is ready-to-eat now. Its flesh contains a rusted strawberry colored jellied pulp laden with the seeds of the fruit. The pulp exudes a candied syrup and confectionery flavors that darker figs cannot achieve. Younger fruits are leaner in flavor, lower in sugar content and the flesh is generally more cottony in texture with a less jellied seed cavity. The leaves of the fig tree are also an edible part of the plant.

Seasons/Availability
Green figs are available summer into fall.

Current Facts
Figs grow on the Ficus tree (Ficus carica), which is a member of the mulberry family. There are almost two hundred cultivars of figs, thus they grow in a wide range of shapes, colors and textures. There are dozens of Green fig varieties, including the celestial fig. Other green fig varieties include (Green) garnsey, kadota, St. John, calimyrna, verte, ventura, panachee and adriatic. The adriatic fig is the most commonly known green fig and it is the fig that is most often used to make fig bars.

Nutritional Value
Figs are a great source of calcium and dietary fiber. They are rich in antioxidants and when dried they develop higher percentages of minerals such as copper, magnesium and potassium.

Applications
Green figs are sweeter than both brown turkey and black mission figs, making them a better choice for desserts and as a dried (candied) fig. Green figs can also be used as a substitute for brown turkey and black mission figs in salads paired with mild goat cheeses, sheep's cheeses such as manchego and fresh cow's milk cheeses. Figs make incredible jams and sauces, both sweet and savory. They are great accouterments to pork belly and roasted lamb. Figs are also, of course, great for eating fresh out of hand. Once harvested figs have a brief shelf life and should be eaten within a few days of ripening.

Geography/History
Figs are one of the very first plants to be cultivated by humans. They have been documented throughout history as a food source for over 11,000 years. They were first cultivated in ancient Egypt, though they are believed to be indigenous to western Asia. Figs still have a huge presence in northern Africa and throughout the eastern Mediterranean, specifically Greece and Turkey. They have been naturalized in the western Mediterranean and throughout temperate regions of the United States, primarily Southern California. Green fig varieties are native to the eastern Mediterranean, Italy (adriatic fig) and even California, where new fig varieties were developed via propagation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Fig
Description/Taste
Black Mission fig "fruit" has a tough peel (in this case, green giving way to deep purple), often cracking near the stem end upon ripeness, and exposing the pulp beneath. The soft creamy white interior contains a seed mass bound with jelly-like flesh. The edible seeds are numerous and generally hollow, unless pollinated. Pollinated seeds provide the characteristic nutty taste of dried figs.

Seasons/Availability
Black figs are available in early spring through early winter. Beginning in winter, night temperatures drop causing a change in the fruit's texture and the fig is no longer at its best for culinary use. The interior of the fig becomes woody and dry, and the seeds begin to separate from the flesh.

Current Facts
Figs grow on the Ficus tree (Ficus carica), which is a member of the Mulberry family. There are almost two hundred cultivars of figs, thus they grow in a wide range of shapes, colors and textures. The common fig bears a first crop, called the breba crop, in the spring on last season's growth. The second crop is born in the fall on the new growth and is known as the main crop. Figs are botanically an inverted flower. Each fig is not a single fruit, but nearly fifteen hundred tiny fruits. Figs made their first commercial product appearance with the 1892 introduction of Fig Newtons® Cookies.

Applications
When Black Mission Figs are blended with savory ingredients, such as salt, cocoa and spices, figs can produce a “meaty” flavor that has a smoky, almost steak-like aroma and taste. Chop fresh figs and thyme, then fold into olive oil-based cake batter and bake. Whip blue cheese and heavy cream, the pipe into halved figs, top with toasted hazelnuts and serve as an appetizer. Saute roasted beets and quartered figs in honey and balsamic vinegar, then toss with arugula and serve as a salad. Top puff pastry dough with crumbled goat cheese, chopped or halved figs and sliced prosciutto, then bake into a tart. To store, lay figs on paper towels; cover with plastic; refrigerate no more than three days. Use ripe figs immediately.

Geography/History
Figs are one of the very first plants to be cultivated by humans. They have been documented throughout history as a food source for over 11,000 years. They were first cultivated in ancient Egypt though they are believed to be indigenous to western Asia. They still have a huge presence in northern Africa and throughout the eastern Mediterranean, specifically Greece and Turkey. They have been naturalized in the western Mediterranean and throughout temperate regions of the United States, primarily Southern California. The Black Mission Fig is native to the Balearic Islands, an archipelago of Spain in the western Mediterranean Sea. Spaniards brought the fig to America in 1520. The (California) Mission fig received its given name in honor of the missionary fathers - priests at Mission San Diego, who originally planted figs in California in 1769. In the late 1880s, fig orchards covered much of the area within the city limits of Fresno, the heart of the central San Joaquin Valley, the largest agricultural sector of California. Figs require full sun all day to ripen palatable fruits. Cold springs and cloudy summers can lead to a dismal fig season.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gac
Description/Taste
Gac fruits is the size of a small melon and grows on climbing vines than can reach 6 meters long. They are often found growing on lattices or arbors in gardens and rural homes throughout Vietnam. The fruits first appear green, but later ripen to a dark orange color and have a rounded oblong shape approximately 13 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter. The coarse rind has a spiny exterior that covers a layer of light orange spongy flesh called the mesocarp, which is usually discarded. The inner core is packed with edible, magenta-red oily sacs that are very mild in taste. They have a moderate sweetness some may compare to the fresh fruitiness of a cucumber or melon with a hint of carrot.

Seasons/Availability
Gac fruit is available for a few months in the fall.

Current Facts
Gac Fruit, or simply Gac as it is referred to in Southeast Asia, is a tropical vine that is botanically classified as Momordica cochinchinensis. It is also commonly known as Baby Jackfruit, Spiny Bitter Gourd, Sweet Gourd or Cochinchin Gourd. It has an extremely short season, a mere two months long, but the fruit plays an important role in celebratory dishes as well as in natural medicine. Until recently, Gac has been a mystery outside of its native lands, but the juice has since been marketed as a dietary supplement because of its allegedly high phytonutrient content.

Nutritional Value
Gac has an especially high lycopene content, containing up to 70 times the amount of lycopene found in tomatoes. It also has 10 times the amount of beta-carotene found in carrots or sweet potatoes. In Vietnam, the seed membranes are used to aid in eye health.

Applications
The juicy inner pulp of the Gac may be eaten raw on its own or blended with other fruits to make a juice. It is most commonly cooked with sticky rice in a dish called Xoi Gac, in which the fruit’s deep red color and mildly fruity flavor is extracted. The young shoots of the vines are also eaten as a vegetable, simply steamed and paired with nam phrik (chili-based Thai condiment). An unconventional yet delicious way to enjoy the health benefits of Gac is to combine it with tomato sauce and use on a pizza or with pasta.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
During the Vietnamese Tet holiday, Gac is prepared in a festive sticky rice dish called Xoi Gac which is flavored with cinnamon and stained bright red with the fruit’s pulp.

Geography/History
Gac is native to Vietnam and may be found growing all throughout the warmer climates of Southeast Asia. The vines are prolific producers, typically fruiting within 8 months of being planted, but the actual germination of the seeds can be much longer if conditions are not warm enough. The plant has had some mild success growing in colder regions, but requires extensive time in the heat of a greenhouse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gooseberry
Description/Taste
Gooseberries come in many textural finishes: smooth, fuzzy, spiny, opaque and translucent, always with a taut skin and tomato-like flesh. The Green gooseberry differs from the Cape gooseberry with one major distinction - it does not contain a husk. With Green gooseberries, sizes and flavor may vary: they may be as big as a cherry tomato or as tiny as a blueberry. They may also be tart or slightly sweet, though always measuring high in acid.

Seasons/Availability
Gooseberries are available year-round.

Current Facts
The Gooseberry, botanical name, Ribes uva-crispa and syn. Ribes grossularia, is a species of the Ribes genus. Ribes is a genus of about 150 species of flowering plants, including Gooseberries' closest botanical relative, the currant. There are hundreds of varieties of gooseberries, of which the most common are Old Rough Red and Hairy Amber.

Applications
Fresh Gooseberry's sweet-tart flavor and earthiness can lend itself to several applications: sweet, savory, cooked, raw, whole, mashed, pureed, preserved, even pickled. Gooseberries can be utilized in savory applications alongside fresh, creamy and aged cheeses, sausages, pork, lamb and within fresh salads. Complimentary ingredients include pistachios, pine nuts, almonds, bramble berries, stone fruit, aged balsamic vinegar, salad greens such as butter lettuce and arugula, apples, fresh and dried figs, fennel, bacon and basil.

Geography/History
Gooseberries are native to Europe, northwestern Africa, and all regions of Asia except for the north. The Gooseberry plant flourishes in several climates, not excluding the Arctic Circle, where it can be found growing wild. Though it still exists prevalently in the wild, Gooseberries require being planted via cuttings versus seed when cultivated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grapefruit
Description/Taste
Grapefruits are medium-large, oblate fruits with yellow or pink-yellow thick skin. They usually measure between three to five inches in diameter. Grapefruits are categorized as white, pink, and ruby, based on their flesh color. Some varieties are seedless, while others have up to fifty seeds. The flavor is tart and tangy but sweet.

Seasons/Availability
Grapefruits are available year-round.

Current Facts
The grapefruit is a citrus that is a cross between an orange and a pomelo, with the botanical name Citrus paradisi. The common name of grapefruit comes from Jamaica, where locals referred to the way the fruit grew in clusters like grapes. Grapefruits are one of the most popular cultivated fruits in the United States. There are over twenty varieties growing in the US alone.

Nutritional Value
Grapefruit is very high in Vitamin C—a single grapefruit half supplies the entire daily recommended value of this vitamin, and also contains fiber, beta carotene, and Vitamin A. Red and pink grapefruits additionally contain lycopene, a substance that fights free radicals and protects cells from damage.

Applications
Most people enjoy grapefruit fresh as a snack or for breakfast. Slice them in half and scoop out the halved sections with a spoon, or peel like an orange and divide into sections. Grapefruit juice is also delicious, and the fruit can be used in salad recipes, with seafood, or in sauces. The best grapefruits are firm, have smooth skins, and are heavy for their size. They should smell slightly sweet. Store them at room temperature for a week or in the refrigerator crisper for up to three weeks.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Grapefruits are the only known citrus to have originated in the Americas, and their production remains concentrated in this hemisphere. Florida alone produces two million tons of grapefruits a year.

Geography/History
Grapefruits were only discovered by the world at large relatively recently, but became popular quickly. They were growing in the Caribbean island of Barbados by the eighteenth century. People brought grapefruits to the Florida in the early- to mid-1800s, where they became a commercial crop a few decades later. Today, grapefruits are grown commercially in Florida, California, Arizona, and Texas in the US, and in South Africa, Israel, and Brazil.

Green Grape
Description/Taste
Green seedless grapes may be round to slightly oval in shape depending upon variety. Their color ranges from yellowish-green to bright green while their inner pulp is semi-translucent. They are sweet and tart with mellow tannins that leave a slight layer of flavor on the tongue. When picking, choose bunches with healthy green stems as this indicates freshness.

Seasons/Availability
Green seedless grapes are available year-round, with peak season in the summer and fall.

Current Facts
There are three main types of Green table grapes grown around the world; European (Vitis vinifera), North American (V. labrusca) and hybrids of the two. The most prominent Green seedless variety is the Thompson. They are known for their crisp snappy texture and mildly tannic skin.

Nutritional Value
Green seedless grapes contain vitamins A, C and K, and are considered a "super food." They aid in boosting the immune system, and because of their high fluid content, grapes are a good way to replenish electrolytes when needed.

Applications
Green seedless grapes are most often eaten raw out-of-hand, but they also make excellent juice and raisins. They may be roasted and cooked down into sauces and jams, or frozen and whipped into an instant sorbet. The lightly sweet yet tart flavor of Green grape juice is perfect for cocktails and wine spritzers. Complimentary flavors include, almond, pistachio, hazelnut, walnut, peanut, lemon, strawberry, raspberry, endive, arugula, fennel, rosemary, mint, yogurt, sour cream, crème fraiche, goat cheese, blue cheese, pork, duck and poultry. To store, place lightly washed grapes in a perforated plastic bag and refrigerate.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
A popular New Year’s Eve tradition in Spain dating back to the 1880s involves eating twelve Green grapes, each symbolizing one month of the year. The tradition known as “The 12 Lucky Grapes” has revelers eating one grape after each toll from the bells after midnight on New Year’s Eve. If you can eat all twelve grapes by the end of the final bell’s toll, you will have good luck in the New Year. Local vineyards in Spain even sell small cans filled with exactly twelve green grapes.

Geography/History
Green grapes have been found to date back as far as 6000 BC and are native to the Mediterranean region. They are grown today in Europe, North America, France, Australia, Chile, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. To flourish, grapes need a warm to hot dry summer and a mild winter. The humidity of the tropics does not bode well for grapes. In the United States, over 90% of the Green grapes are grown in the state of California. The great grape rush began in California in 1839 when the transcontinental railroad came to California in 1869. Grapes could be transported all over the country.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Grape
Description/Taste
The hue of a Red seedless grape can vary widely depending on the variety, but usually ranges from a light red to a deep burgundy. The shape of the berry is generally round to slightly oblong and is medium in size. The dusty film or bloom on the skin is produced by cells in or near the surface. This layer forms a natural waterproof coat which prevents the delicate skin from cracking. Red seedless grapes are sweet and crisp, occasionally tart and always juicy.

Seasons/Availability
Red seedless grapes are available year-round, with peak season in the summer and fall.

Current Facts
There are three main species of Red table grapes grown around the world; European (Vitis vinifera), North American (V. labrusca) and hybrids of the two. Red seedless grapes came to market after their green cousins, but very quickly surpassed them in popularity. The Red Flame is one of the most widely seen varieties of Red seedless grape on the market.

Nutritional Value
Red seedless grapes containt significant amounts of vitamins A, C and K which aid in boosting the immune system. Because of its high fluid content, grapes are a good way to replenish electrolytes when needed. Flavonoids, such as resveratrol, within the Red seedless grape’s skin provide high antioxidant qualities, which can reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease.

Applications
Red seedless grapes are most often eaten raw out-of-hand, but they also make excellent juice and raisins. They may be roasted and cooked down into sauces and jams, or frozen and whipped into an instant sorbet. The lightly sweet yet tart flavor of Red grape juice is perfect for cocktails and wine spritzers. Complimentary flavors include, almond, pistachio, hazelnut, walnut, peanut, lemon, strawberry, raspberry, endive, arugula, fennel, rosemary, mint, yogurt, sour cream, crème fraiche, goat cheese, blue cheese, pork, duck and poultry. To store, place lightly washed grapes in a perforated plastic bag and refrigerate.

Geography/History
Vitis labrusca or the Fox grape, has been grown for centuries in the Mediterranean region. This red grape variety has been used for wine since ancient times. Seedlessness has become a highly-desirable trait in table grapes, so much that seedless grapes are planted more than the seeded varieties. Cross-breeding of several ancient cultivars, the Black Monukka, the Russian Seedless, and the Thompson Seedless, have resulted in the Red seedless grapes currently grown for market. Red Flame grapes are by far the most popular and the most widely distributed Red seedless grape. A cross between the seeded Flame Tokay and Thompson seedless grapes, the Red Flame was developed by a breeding program in Fresno, California in the 1970s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Concord Grape
Description/Taste
Varying in color from deep blue to purple or almost black, the large round Concord grape grows in loose clusters on sturdy climbing vines. A powdery film, or bloom, develops on the skin’s surface which provides a natural waterproofing and also prevents cracking. The berries’ thick, tannin-rich skin offers a pleasant chewiness against the juicy and almost gelatinous inner pulp. The seedy flesh is almost translucent with a slight green tinge and is both tangy and rich. The grape’s unique sweet musky flavor is sometimes described as “foxy”, alluding to the species’ alias, the fox grape.

Seasons/Availability
Concord Grapes are available from late summer into early fall.

Current Facts
The Concord grape is a variety of Vitis labrusca that is named after the city of its origin, Concord, Massachusetts. It has been a part of American viticulture since 1843 and one of the oldest domestically cultivated grapes still grown today. These blue-skinned grapes are responsible for making the famous and popular Concord grape jelly and have become a major crop throughout the United States.

Nutritional Value
Concord grapes are and excellent source of vitamin C and the phytonutrient, Resveratrol, an important chemical in maintaining heart health.

Applications
The Concord grape is incredibly versatile and used for making preserves, juice, wine, liqueur and vinegar. When eaten raw out of hand, watch for seeds in this tart, but succulent-tasting grape. The intense grapey flavor makes an excellent tangy sorbet that pairs well with rich creamy desserts such as cheesecake or panna cotta and, of course, peanut butter. Other complimentary flavors include, almond, pistachio, hazelnut, walnut, peanut, lemon, strawberry, raspberry, endive, arugula, fennel, rosemary, mint, yogurt, sour cream, crème fraiche, goat cheese, blue cheese, pork, duck and poultry.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Grape juice was first made by Dr. Thomas Welch, a prohibitionist, making his famous grape juice as an alternative for communion wine.

Geography/History
Concord grapes originated in Concord, Massachusetts in 1849 when Ephraim Wales Bull first cultivated them. Bull wanted to create a hardy vine that could survive the cold climate of Massachusetts. He initially planted 22,000 seedlings and after 6 years chose one single vine that proved to yield the best fruit, and that original vine is still thriving today in Concord! Winter hardy, the vigorous plants can produce over twenty pounds of fruit per vine per year and often live for more than forty years. In the United States, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington are major producers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guava
Description/Taste
Guavas, AKA Apple guavas received its name because its coloring is so similar to that of a green apple, with hues of lemon and lime. The fruit is roughly spherical with a furrowed smooth surface. The most alluring element of a Guava is its fragrance, a bouquet of bright tropical aromatics. The flesh is unique to many fruits, its texture a combination of a firm banana with the succulence of an apple. Tiny edible seeds pattern the flesh's core. The flavor of Guava is a reflection of its aromatics, though more subtle with notes of pineapple, papaya, banana and lemon.

Seasons/Availability
Guavas are available from beginning spring through winter.

Current Facts
The general classification of the Guava includes over 100 different species. Even what may be considered the common market Guava, which is better known as Apple guava (Psidium guava), is actually a family of dozens of different cultivars. These cultivars vary from the size of an apricot to the size of an orange. Colorings vary from pale yellow to pink, yet Apple guavas maintain similar shapes, flavor profiles and aromatics.

Applications
Although Guava is a fruit, its culinary uses are nearly unlimited. Guava can be eaten whole for simple fresh eaten. They may be used for applications both sweet and savory, fresh, cooked, hot and cold. Perfect companion ingredients which will bring out more complexity of flavor in a Guava include bananas, chocolate, mango, ginger, pears, vanilla, cinnamon and sweet wines such as Gewurtztraminer. Guavas can be paired with soft cheeses such as chevre and mascarpone, seafood such as shrimp, scallops and halibut, and fatty meats like bacon, pork loin and pork chops. Guavas are a perfect dessert ingredient in ice creams, gelatos, sorbets, panna cotta and custards. Guava can be baked, sautéed, caramelized and pureed, preserved and jammed. You can also add Guava to juice blends and dry or dehydrate it, which will change its texture and concentrate its flavors. Post-harvest Guavas can be kept at room temperature for up to 7 days, depending on ripeness.

Geography/History
The Apple guava is the fruit of small trees (also known as evergreen shrubs) native to tropical and subtropical regions of Mexico, Central and South Americas and the Caribbean. It has been easily naturalized in other tropical regions throughout the world and its adaptability makes it very suitable to be grown in commercial groves and as a container plant in temperate climates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Honeydew
Description/Taste
The Honeydew has a smooth, firm pale cornflower colored skin that encases sweet, pale green flesh. Round to oval and somewhat larger than a cantaloupe, this melon's skin turns from green to white to yellow as it matures. As the Honeydew ripens, its skin transforms from very hard and smooth to a velvety texture and often develops a slight stickiness. If the blossom end yields to gentle pressure, the melon is ready to eat. Honeydew melons range in weight from four to eight pounds. Once a Honeydew melon is picked, it can no longer get any sweeter. When it is harvested determines how sweet the melon is. Vine-ripened melons picked at their peak maturity will have the best flavor and highest sugar content.

Seasons/Availability
Honeydew melons are available year-round.

Current Facts
The Honeydew melon is muskmelon variety falling under the Honeydew cultivator group, Cucumis melo inodorus. Winter melons are called such because they ripen slowly and are not ready to eat until late fall. The Honeydew melon AKA Balian or Wallace melon, like other winter melons, is hardy and has a long shelf-life, which contributes highly to its commercial value and success. In America it is one of the most commercially successful winter melons on the market today, this is due largely in part to its exceptionally sweet flesh that can reach up to sixteen degrees on the Brix refractometer reading.

Applications
Honeydew melons are most often used in fresh preparations such as fruit salads or cold soups. Pureed it can be added to sauces, smoothies, cocktails and syrups. The sweet flavor of the Honeydew melon will complement breakfast and dessert preparations. Honeydew pairs well with lime, mint, basil, sweet cream, cottage cheese, fruity olive oil and fresh berries. Substitute Honeydew for any green-fleshed melon in recipes. Store unripe melons at room temperature. Refrigerate ripe melons in a plastic bag for two to three days. Once cut, cover and keep refrigerated.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
In France the Honeydew melon was originally known as Melon d'Antibes Blanc d'Hiver or White Antibes Winter melon.

Geography/History
The Honeydew melon is the American name for the White Antibes cultivar that was primarily cultivated in southern France and Algeria as early as the late fifteenth century. In 1911 in New York a White Antibes melon was served in a dish at a restaurant and a guest that evening found the melon to be to exceptional that he saved a seed and sent it to the plant breeder John E. Gauger in Colorado to grow. In 1915 the USDA identified the melon as White Antibes and the melon was renamed Honeydew. Like many varieties of melon the Honeydew plants thrive in a hot dry climate.

The tree bearing Jack fruit can produce one hundred-fifty to two hundred-fifty fruits a year. Jack fruit hang from the tree and are suspended on sturdy stalks that grow along its main trunk and larger branches.

Applications
Immature fruit is excellent boiled, fried, or roasted like a vegetable.  Mix ripe jack fruit in curries and in fruit salad. Baked or cooked, Jack fruit makes desserts, preserves, and syrup. Seeds can be boiled or roasted and enjoyed as a snack or ground up and used as a seasoning.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Asian cuisine uses this special fruit as a condiment and adds slices to their special curries.

Geography/History
Growing in the rain forests, the origin of this fruit is from India to the Malay Peninsula.  The name "jack" comes from Portuguese explorers in the sixteenth century, as it sounded like "tsjaka," the Malay word for this fruit.  This giant fruit now grows in most tropical areas, including South Florida and Southeast Asia.

Jelly Palm
Description/Taste
Jelly palm fruit is tarty, sweet and about the size of a small cherry, with a similar drupe-like shape. The petite, round fruits grow in clusters like grapes on the Pindo palm tree. Fruits grow to be one half to one inch in diameter and have a thin golden yellow skin which often has a slight red blush when the fruit is ripe. The flesh surrounds a single large, black seed and is buttery yellow in color with a soft and juicy texture. Both the skin and fruit are edible and have a tropical flavor which has nuances of apricot, pineapple, coconut and banana.

Seasons/Availability
Jelly palm fruit is available during the summer months.

Current Facts
Jelly palm fruit also known as Palm date, Wine palm, Yatay and botanically as Butia capitata. The Pindo palm tree, as it is known, is a member of the Arecaceae family. Jelly palm fruit is often eaten fresh, off the tree, though its name comes from the most common preparation for these small fruits - jelly. These fruits are foraged and are not cultivated for commercial sale.

Applications
Jelly palm fruits are eaten fresh, off the short palm tree on which they grow. Often foraged, the Jelly palm fruits are found on short, squat Pindo palm trees in yards and on street corners. The fruits are high in pectin and can be made into jelly or jam without requiring the use of additional pectin or solidifiers. The high pectin content makes for a cloudier wine, which is another common use for the Jelly palm fruits. These small, banana-colored fruit are very fibrous and it isn’t uncommon for the skin and fibrous flesh to be spit out once the juice is consumed. The fruit is highly perishable and can be stored in the refrigerator for only a few days after picking.

Geography/History
Native to Brazil, Pindo palm trees were named after a town in Southern Brazil where they were first discovered. The name Butia capitata is derived from the Portuguese word Butia, meaning 'spiny' and the Latin capitata meaning ‘with a dense head’ referring to the plant’s seeds. The Pindo palm is a common ornamental tree in South America and also in the Southern US from Florida to southern coastal California; it is the hardiest of the feather-leaf palms in wide cultivation. Often the Jelly palm fruit can be mistaken for the fruit of the Queen palm, which are inedible. These other fruits are a striking orange color, whereas the Jelly palm fruits are always yellow. Jelly palm fruit is most often foraged and may be found at local farmers markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jujube
Description/Taste
Somewhat pear-shaped or round and just about the size of a golf ball, the small jujube resembles a large yellowish apple covered with a rather hardy skin. This fruit varies from light yellow-green to an almost light shade of kelly green. Inside is a hard kernel, inedible pointed seeds and a rather pithy acidic pulp. Its unique texture is almost like a succulent caramel. This crisp little fruit charmer offers its very own lively flavor that is quite different from any other.

Seasons/Availability
Jujube's are available in summer through fall.

Current Facts
Jujubes are a member of the Rhamnaceae or Buckthorn family and are botanically known as Ziziphus jujuba. Jujubes are also commonly known as Chinese dates, Korean dates, red dates or tsao. There are over 400 jujube varieties available today, but it was not until 1908 that more desirable Chinese varieties were introduced by the USDA.

Nutritional Value
This rare fruit is rich in vitamin C.

Applications
Usually this fruit is candied but may be enjoyed fresh. Stew in honey or sugar syrup.  Make a jujube cake or cookies. Add jujubes to sautéed vegetables for an unusual sweet twist. Substitute dried jujubes for raisins or dates. Wine can even be made from jujubes. To store, refrigerate.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
In China, this special fruit is popular dried or preserved in syrup. Its juice was formerly used for making lozenges to help alleviate chest pain. Because of this, the word "jujube" acquired the meaning of "a confection, sweetmeat, or medicated lozenge, round, oblong, or square in shape," as quoted in Law's Grocers' Manual of c 1895 explaining, however, that these said jujubes are made with gum Arabic or other gums, not made with the actual jujube fruits.

Geography/History
Thought to be native to Syria and China, jujubes are primarily grown in China. Produced on an ornamental small thorny tree, this fruit loves a dry and mild climate. Being able to survive in cooler temperatures, it grows in Mediterranean countries and has since biblical times. Chinese gardeners developed the small fruit until it became superior and dessert quality. Loving life in both hemispheres, jujubes are now cultivated in Japan, Iran and Afghanistan. They remain a favorite in the Mediterranean. Jujube trees now love life in the United States and thrive in California, Florida and the southwestern region.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kiwi
Description/Taste
About the size of an egg, kiwifruit is wrapped in a russet-brown thin skin with short rather stiff hairs. The kaleidoscope-like almost glistening emerald green firm pulp is dotted with a large amount of dark nearly black tiny edible seeds that create this fruit's characteristic interior starburst pattern. Sometimes the flesh may be yellow, brownish or off-white. Sweet tart with a slightly acidic edge, this decorative fruit's succulent flavor is mainly sweet.

Seasons/Availability
Kiwifruit is available from California during the winter months. New Zealand kiwifruit is available in spring and supplies arrive from Chile during the summer months.

Current Facts
According to the California Kiwifruit Commission, kiwi fruit were the fastest-growing fruit in sales and distribution from 1987 to 1995.

Nutritional Value
Kiwifruit is rich in vitamin C, having ten times more than the equal weight of a lemon. Two fruits have almost twice the vitamin C of an orange and more potassium than a comparable serving of bananas.  High in fiber, it also offers vitamin A, Vitamin E, calcium and iron. Credit goes to all those little black seeds, as they act much like grains, providing lots of nutrition.

Applications
Puree; enhance juices and beverages. Even though the skin is edible, the fruit is usually peeled. Slice for garnish. Containing a meat-tenderizing enzyme, place sliced peels with some flesh attached directly on meat; marinate thirty minutes for each inch of the meat's thickness. To make a kiwifruit salsa, blend four peeled kiwis, one teaspoon minced jalapeño pepper, one tablespoon orange juice, one tablespoon chopped fresh mint and a pinch of salt. Serve with grilled swordfish, grilled poultry and roast pork. Bananas, berries, mangoes, strawberries, raspberries and oranges are especially partial to kiwifruit. To store, refrigerate ripe fruit up to ten days. Refrigerated unripe fruit lasts up to one month.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The French word, souris vegetale, for this fruit translates to "vegetable mouse".

Geography/History
Native to the Yangtze River Valley of northern China and Zhejiang Province on the coast of eastern China, this fruit was first grown commercially in New Zealand. England received their very first kiwifruit shipment in 1953. Not frost-tolerant, the vigorous woody twining vine or climbing shrubby plants require a long growing season. Only fully dormant plants can survive temperatures around ten degrees Fahrenheit. The rambling vines are capable of stretching to cover an area ten to fifteen feet wide, eighteen to twenty-four feet long and nine to twelve feet high. Producing deep green leathery-textured oval to round leaves that can grow seven to ten inches in diameter, fragrant one to two inch wide white to cream colored flowers appear in the leaf axils. In the United States, California produces about ninety-nine percent of the nation's kiwifruit supply.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lemon
Description/Taste
Lemons are heavily utilized as a flavoring agent in various forms. The fruit is ovate with pointed ends. Its peel is semi-thick, porous and laden with essential oils. The bright yellow thin outer layer of the peel is very edible and used for multiple applications. When the peel is removed or zested it releases intense sweet citrus aromas. The flesh is translucent yellow and juicy when ripe. Its juice is highly acidic and tart, though extremely versatile in its uses. Depending on variety, lemons may contain no seeds or numerous seeds.

Seasons/Availability
Lemons are available year-round.

Current Facts
The true lemon, Citrus limon is known as limone, limón, limón agria, limón real, or limón francés. It is a member of the family, Rutaceae. Most common commercial lemon varieties are either Lisbon or the Eureka lemon, of which hybrids of the Eureka lemon are even more common as they are improved versions of the original. Most other true lemon varieties are grown in gardens or for limited production on a local market scale.

Applications
Lemons are versatile and can be added to a wide variety of dishes across almost every cuisine. Add juice or zest to soups, dips, mayonnaise and whipped cream. Cook whole lemon slices into marmelade or cook with eggs and butter into curd. Pack lemon slices in salt to preserve. Flavor cakes, breads or scones. Make scented sugar by rubbing lemon zest into sugard granules. Juice fresh lemons and combine with sugar and water to make lemonade, add to cocktails or freeze into granita. Mix with oil for a vinaigrette. Fresh lemons will keep at room temperature or refrigerated for 1-2 weeks.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The lemon is both the pinnacle and ubiquitous citrus of many cultures from Italy to France to Egypt, Spain and America. Its color, aromas, taste and multitasking properties make it the most popular and commercially successful citrus fruit throughout the world. Lemons also have the highest preserving qualities of all citrus making them more suitable for long transports.

Geography/History
The lemon's origins are traced back to northern India, where the lemon tree still grows wild. Lemons were then cultivated in Africa, Europe and eventually the New World. Lemons are known to tolerate drought and poor soil, though they are cold sensitive and require some rainfall for continuous growth. They grow most prolifically in Mediterraneanesque climates. Lemon trees that undergo stress will produce far less yields and inconsistent quality fruits. Original lemon cultivars were propagated by seed but modern varieties are grown on rootstock of both lemon and other citrus varieties. Under ideal conditions lemon tress will produce lemons year round.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lime
Description/Taste
Limes are as obvious in appearance as they are in flavor. They are petite, semi rounded to ovate in shape. Upon harvest, they have a Kelly green, thin, and porous peel, which, when zested releases floral aromatics. Their thinly segmented flesh is a pale lemon lime color, fragrant, juicy and tart with a sour bite. When fully mature Limes become yellow, similar to the color of lemons. The entire fruit is used for culinary applications.

Seasons/Availability
Limes are available year-round.

Current Facts
Limes are botanically classified as citrus aurantifolia, and are one of the smaller members of the citrus family, Rutaceae. Common Lime varieties include the Persian or Tahiti lime, Citrus latifolia, a hybrid developed in the early twentieth century. Persian limes are the single most cultivated variety globally.

Applications
The Lime is perhaps one of the most ubiquitous of all citrus fruits. It is an every day culinary staple in both fresh and juiced form. Its distinctive sour and tart flavor allows the Lime to be a utility ingredient within countless recipes both savory and sweet.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The fruit of the Lime tree is only one of the elements of the plant that is used for its culinary properties. Lime flowers are used in several applications. Spain and France dry the flowers to powder form and use them to make lime tea. The flowers are also used in confections and ice creams and are utilized as bee pollen for honey. Lime leaves are a quintessential ingredient in Southeast Asian cuisines, their aromatics lending themselves to a multitude of dishes from Thailand to Vietnam.

Geography/History
The origin of the most common Lime, the Persian lime, is not fully known or agreed upon. Standard Limes are believed to be a hybrid variety of the small Mexican lime and citron, or possibly a lemon variety. It is generally believed that the Lime originated in Persia, now Iran, where it branched out to the Mediterranean, then Brazil and eventually Australia and Tahiti. From Tahiti, the Lime made traveled to the California coast between 1850 and 1880 and Florida by 1883.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Longan
Description/Taste
Ranging in size from an olive to a small plum and spherical to ovoid in shape, Longans have a thin rough-to-prickly brown easy to remove shell called a pericarp covering its grayish-white translucent pulp. In the center of the juicy flesh is a large smooth jet-black seed with a white ovoid characteristic mark. Having a flesh reminiscent of a peeled grape, the flavor is wonderfully sweet and often described as a mysterious tasting blend of musk, spruce and gardenia.

Seasons/Availability
Longan is available from winter through spring.

Current Facts
New Longan varieties offer a better ratio of pulp to pit and many are "freestone".

Nutritional Value
Longan is an excellent source of potassium and vitamin C, and is very, very low in sodium.

Applications
Poach Longan in light sugar syrup. Peel and pit; use the same way as lychees or pitted cherries in dessert soups, smoothies, fruit salads, cocktails and sweet-and-sour dishes. May be paired with other Asian fruits or mushrooms. To store, keep refrigerated. Freeze fruit in airtight container for longer storage. Thaw just before using but leave fruit slightly frozen for best texture.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The Longan is one of the most prized fruits in Asia. In Thailand especially, the Longan fruit is highly esteemed and is generally eaten at room temperature. The Thai name for this special fruit is Lam-Yai.

Geography/History
Native to China and India, Longan fruit is a major crop in Southeast Asia. The Chinese dubbed it "Dragon's eye" because of its white eye-shaped mark on the pit. The Longan and its close relative the lychee were introduced to the United States by W. N. Brewster, a missionary in Fukien Province, China. Not doing well in cold climates, this tropical tree is often enjoyed as an ornamental shade tree. It produces attractive thick dark evergreen leaves and clusters of drooping fruit. Rather majestic and absolutely gorgeous, this grand tree now grows in America. Since there is a current demand for specialty fruits in the United States, Florida's compatible climate will most likely help to produce this fruit commercially.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loquat
Description/Taste
Loquats grow on trees in clusters of 4-30. They can be smooth or fuzzy, yellow to yellow-orange, and round, oval, or pear-shaped. The flesh texture of a Loquat is smooth and firm, similar to an apricot, with a moderately thick skin reminiscent to a peach. The juicy Loquats flavor starts with a slightly sour and tannic forward and mellows into a lightly sweet and delicate grape finish.

Seasons/Availability
Loquats peak season is mid-winter into spring.

Current Facts
The Loquat, botanically known as Eriobotrya japonica, is also commonly known as the Japanese plum. Loquats are a member of the Rosaceae family, also known as the rose family, along with apples, strawberries and pears. One name for the Loquat in Chinese is pipa, which means lute, the musical instrument that resembles the shape of the Loquat cluster. 

Nutritional Value
Loquats are a source of calcium, potassium, fiber and vitamin A. They are used in Chinese medicine for digestive and respiratory issues. The seeds contain amygdalin, which is used as the cancer drug laetrile. The seeds also contain toxic cyanide compounds.

Applications
Loquats can be used in any recipe that calls for stone fruits like peaches, apricots, or plums. Loquats are high in pectin and make delicious jellies, jams and compotes. They can be pickled and make good salsas and chutneys. The Loquat can be used in sauces for either savory or sweet items, such as meats or ice cream.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Loquat fruit is used in making plum wine. Loquat tree wood has been used in place of pear tree wood in the making of rulers. The fragrant Loquat blossom was considered for use in perfume oils in France, but the small yield did not warrant commercial production. Loquat leaf is dried for use as an herbal tea known as biwa-cha in Japan. Loquats are used in Mexico to celebrate Day of the Dead as offerings and ornaments on the altars.

Geography/History
The Loquat is native to China and is featured in Chinese folklore. It is said that only royalty were permitted to eat the Loquat, as it was believed that the fruit falling into the rivers strengthened the koi to swim up waterfalls and become dragons. Loquats have been in Japan for over a thousand years, and law books from the early 900s described how to properly offer the Loquat to Shinto gods. The Loquat was brought to the west in 1690 and soon made its way to warm climates around the world, including the Middle East, India, Spain, South America, South Africa, and Mexico. In the United States, Loquat trees grow in Southern states, but generally produce fruit only in Hawaii, California and Florida. Currently, Japan is among the largest producers of Loquats. It is an ingredient in many dishes in Japan and is often the featured topic on Japanese tv cooking shows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lychee
Description/Taste
A fresh Lychee is distinctly unique in its appearance. The Lychee is petite, roughly the size of a walnut and its skin is covered with tiny spike-like projections. Young fruits are green and once mature they will become blushed with pink, then bright red. At maturity, the thin inedible leathered skin is covered in hues of rouge. The edible translucent white flesh bears a single central dark brown nut which doubles as the fruit's seed. The flesh's texture is jelly-like, chewy and juicy. At their peak ripeness, Lychees are perfumed with a combination of flavors exotic to most palates. Lychees bring the fragrance of roses, the sweetness of cherries, the acidic brightness of pineapples and the mellow flavor of green grapes together in one mouthful.

Seasons/Availability
Fresh Lychees are available in late spring into mid-summer.

Current Facts
Lychee is a tree fruit and the singular member of the genus Litchi within the soapberry family, which includes chestnut and maple trees. Lychees are a fresh market fruit but their primary commercial market is canning, preserving and drying.

Nutritional Value
Lychees are considered to be a super fruit as a Journal of Nutrition study found that they contain the second highest amounts of polyphenol antioxidants of all known fruits.

Applications
Outside of fresh eating, Lychees primary uses are in desserts, beverages, cocktails and martinis. Lychees are juiced and used to create syrups, ice creams and teas. Classic sweet companion ingredients include mango, coconut, bananas, passion fruit and pineapple. Lychees also pair well with cashews, sesame, honey, oranges, elderflower, cream and soft mild cheeses, tapioca, grapefruit and blueberries.

Geography/History
The Lychee tree is a sub-tropical and tropical tree that is native to Southern China and Malaysia. Wild Lychee trees are one of the dominant tree species of tropical rainforests in Southern China. The Lychee tree has been naturalised throughout Asia as well as in other regions in the Western and Southern Hemispheres with similar climates and terrain. Non-native regions are not always ideal for growing though, often leaving trees with limited crops due to inconsistent fruit bearing. Two elements of successfully domesticating Lychee trees are irrigation and flowering. Once shoots are established, irrigation is held the second autumn those shoots mature. This induces flowering which in turn invites bees to pollinate. Bee colonies pollinate, fruits set and Lychee trees flourish, weather, cultivar and age permitting. Lychees have a short production season and once harvested, they have a very short shelf-life, creating poor storability rates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mango
Description/Taste
Mangoes can be red, yellow, or green on the outside, are smooth-skinned, and have yellow to bright orange flesh and a sweet, sometimes tart flavor.  Because of the variations of skin color in Mango varieties, color doesn't always indicate ripeness. Like an avocado, a Mango that gives to pressure is ripe. Firm Mangoes will ripen at room temperature.

Seasons/Availability
Mangoes are available year-round.

Current Facts
There are hundreds of varieties of Mangoes. The Mango is considered by some to be the most widely consumed fruit in the world. It is known as the "King of Fruits" in India. The botanical name is Mangifera Indica, and the Mango belongs to the same family (Anacardiaceae) as the cashew and pistachio.

Nutritional Value
Mangoes provide fiber, Vitamin A, Vitamin C and potassium. They also contain natural enzymes that assist in breaking down proteins.

Applications
Mango is a popular ingredient for salsas and chutneys worldwide. Sweet Mango is also widely used in desserts and baked goods, along with ice cream and gelato. Mangoes can be sliced and dried in a dehydrator. A chopped Mango lends a tropical taste to fruit smoothies. Because of the natural enzymes, Mangoes are often an ingredient in marinades to tenderize meat.

Geography/History
The Mango is native to Southern Asia, and has been grown in India for thousands of years. Legend has it that Buddha meditated under a Mango tree. The paisley pattern, which comes from India, was inspired by the shape of the Mango.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mulberry
Description/Taste
Mulberries have the immediate appearance of an elongated plump blackberry or a dark loganberry. Their similarities, however, are simply skin deep. Ripe mulberries are almost jet black in color with blushes of ruby. They are aromatic and literally sticky sweet, their coloring so deep and texture so fragile and syrupy in nature that it stains to the touch. They ripen exceedingly fast and should therefore be eaten almost immediately, if not the best modes of preservation are to dry, cook or freeze.

Seasons/Availability
Mulberries are available briefly during mid-summer.

Current Facts
The Mulberry is a member of Moraceae family and the Morus species. It is not actually a berry, but a collective fruit. There are over 150 different species of mulberries that produce red, white, pink and near black fruits.

Applications
Mulberries are commonly used in ice cream, sorbet, jams, jellies, beverages, and especially pies. They can be used in any recipe calling for berries including salads, compotes, reductions, gastriques, purees and cocktails. Complimentary pairings include other bramble berries, stonefruit, young cheeses such as burrata and chevre, pork belly, bacon, herbs such as basil, mint and arugula, cream, mascarpone and citrus.

Geography/History
The earliest documentation of the Mulberry records them as native to China. Mulberries became naturalized in Europe centuries ago and eventually the tree was introduced into America during early colonial times. Today mulberries still grow in China as well as throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East, Northern Africa and within limited regions of the United States.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nectarine
Description/Taste
The nectarine is a rounded fruit with a single central groove. Its smooth skin is blushed with hues of ruby, pink and gold throughout. The flesh is perfumed with aromatics, overtly juicy when ripe, and golden colored with red bleeds at the skin and surrounding the central rough pit. A ripe nectarine's texture is soft with a melting quality, its flavors balanced with layers both bright and sweet.

Seasons/Availability
Nectarines are available year-round with a peak season during late spring and summer.

Current Facts
Nectarines are the result of a natural occurring genetic mutation of the peach. Nectarines, botanical name, Prunus persica nucipersica, are a stone fruit and species within the genus, Prunus, alongside cherries, apricots, plums and almonds. There are two types of nectarines: yellow-fleshed and white fleshed. White-fleshed nectarines are typically low or sub-acid while yellow-fleshed nectarines are both sweet and tart.

Nutritional Value
A nectarine seed is considered highly inedible as it can contain high levels of poisonous hydrogen cyanide. This toxin is readily detected by its bitter taste. The fruit of nectarine has high levels of beta carotene, calcium and vitamin C. Herbalists use the branches and leaves of nectarine trees as a demulcent, for stomach disorders and as a kidney and intestine detoxant.

Applications
Nectarines are suitable to be used in any recipe calling for peaches. They are best for eating fresh out of hand, yet they can also be poached, grilled, made into a compote, syrup, jelly and infused into drinks or added to dessert recipes such as cakes, pies and ice cream. Nectarines pair well with other stone fruit such as apricots, cherries and almonds, citrus, berries, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, cream and custards. Savory pairings include herbs such as basil, cilantro and arugula, hazelnut and pistachio nuts and oil, aged cheeses such as parmesan and mild cheeses such as ricotta and burrata, sausages, pork belly and grilled fish. The flowers of nectarine trees can be steeped and used to impart flavors in teas.

Geography/History
The definitive origin of nectarines is unknown.  Documentation of the first nectarine was recorded in English in 1616. As peaches are native to central Asia, though, there is geographical speculation that the first nectarine was found growing on a peach tree within the same region and trade routes brought it to Europe in the 15th century. Genetic studies have concluded that nectarines are created due to a recessive allele.  Without two copies of a gene, specific genetic traits will not be inherited. Thus, the nectarine naturally evolved as a fuzz-free peach.  The lack of fuzz contributes to the fruit's brighter colorings and to its ability to bruise more easily.  Nectarines still occur as bud mutations on peach trees.  The trees' preferred climate is similar to that of the peach. Their growing regions are regulated by the seasons. Only in spring and summer will fruit become ripe. Nectarine trees need rainy winters and hot dry summers. Cultivation occurs in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres which experience opposite summers and winters allowing for year round availability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noni Fruit
Description/Taste
Noni is about the size of an average russet potato with a lumpy texture. The skin of the Noni fruit is semi-transparent and can range in color between pale yellow and lime green. The flesh is off-white, semi gelatinous and houses many dark brown seeds around its center. The Noni fruit has a distinct and fowl smell, often compared to vomit with a bitter, sharp flavor.

Seasons/Availability
Noni fruit is available year-round with gaping in the winter months.

Current Facts
Noni fruit, botanically known as Morinda citrifolia, grows on a small tropical evergreen tree in the Rubiaceae plant family. There are 80 types of Morinda that exist throughout its tropical growing regions with 3 varieties, including Morinda citrifolia var. citrifolia, being the most common. Due to its potent and unpleasant odor the Noni fruit is commonly referred to as "cheese fruit" or "vomit fruit".

Nutritional Value
Noni fruit contains natural enzymes and immune boosting anthraguinones and polysaccharides. Noni fruit boasts proxeronine, which aids in the absorption of vitamins and minerals, as well as vitamins A and C. Noni fruit is available for medicinal use in fresh, powdered, juice, tea and supplemental pill forms. Noni is used for a range of treatments from diabetes to fever, though the effectiveness has yet to be studied clinically and claims are not supported by the FDA.

Applications
Noni fruit can be consumed raw out of hand, though many find its flavor much more palatable blended as a juice. It is common practice to mix the pungent Noni fruit juice with other varying fruit juices to help mask the unpleasant flavor. Noni may be used in cooked applications such as curries and sauces, jams and jellies. Another common application is to cook the Noni fruit with other fruits, blend it and dry it into fruit leather.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
For over 2,000 years the Polynesian people have used Noni fruit and its tree for many basic survival needs. The wood of the Noni plant was burned for fire, the bark was ground up and used in the production of yellow and red cloth dyes, the leaves were fed to livestock as a supplemental feed and the fruit was consumed as a prescribed medicinal treatment. Because of its unpleasant flavor the Polynesian people considered the Noni fruit a "famine food", consumed for survival after natural disasters had wiped out most other vegetation.

Geography/History
Noni developed around the tropical islands surrounding New Guinea where its ability to thrive in new lava flows gave it a distinct advantage over all other native plants. Approximately 3,200 years ago the migrations of humans from the New Guinea area helped transplant the Noni to neighboring regions such as Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. The spread of Noni is directly related to the colonization of the Polynesian people and their culture throughout the Pacific.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orange
Description/Taste
The taste and shape of the orange is familiar to people all over the globe. The orange or yellow-orange fruits are globular and covered with oil glands. The outer rind covers a white inner rind, which in turn covers the yellow, orange, or red flesh. Oranges generally have ten to fourteen segments that are fairly easy to separate, and which contain a few seeds, or in some cases are seedless. The taste of oranges varies from sweeter to more acidic, based on the species.

Seasons/Availability
There are many varietes of oranges and they can be found year-round.

Current Facts
Oranges, part of the Rutacaea family, are not one of the original citrus species that occur in the wild. Instead, they are a hybrid of pomelos and mandarins. There are many varieties of oranges, which can be divided into types including sweet and bitter. Some of the more commercially-important varieties include Washington navel, Valencia, Satsuma, and Seville, although there are an estimated 600 varieties in total. Oranges are one of the most important fruits in global trade.

Nutritional Value
Oranges are low in calories, fat, sodium, and cholesterol, but do contain many healthy nutrients such as potassium, calcium, and fiber. They are especially known for their high Vitamin C content—one medium orange contains over 100 percent of the daily recommended value of Vitamin C.

Applications
Oranges are most often eaten fresh or consumed as juice. They can be cut up to use in salads and desserts, or as garnishes for meat and poultry. Orange peel is also edible, and is sometimes candied or zested as flavoring for a variety of dishes. The pectin found in this fruit make oranges a great candidate to add to fruit preserves, or to make into marmalade. In fact, the pectin found in stores comes from the inner layer of orange peels. Choose oranges that are firm and feel heavy; these fruits will have more juice. Store them for two weeks at room temperature or longer in the fridge.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The high Vitamin C content of oranges has historically made them a solution for sailors  looking to prevent scurvy, a deficiency of this vitamin. Sailors would plant orange trees along their trade routes to pick and bring with them along the way, spreading oranges all over the globe.

Geography/History
While oranges do not grow in the wild, they have been grown in southern China, India, and Southeast Asia for thousands of years. They were brought to the Mediterranean by traders in the 1400s. Christopher Columbus is thought to have been brought to North America, along with other Spanish and French explorers. In the United States, oranges were growing in Florida by 1565 and in California by 1769. Today, oranges are grown commercially all over the world in subtropical areas, from South Africa, to Australia, to South America. Brazil is a particularly large producer, while Florida and California lead American production.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mexican Papaya
Description/Taste
Mexican papaya turn greenish-yellow with shades of orange when ripe and contain numerous round, shiny, inedible black seeds in its center cavity. Somewhat similar to a melon, its delectable flesh is firm and juicy. The flavor, however, is not quite as sweet as the common papaya.

Seasons/Availability
Mexican papaya are available year-round.

Current Facts
Mexican papaya is one of the fastest growing tropical fruits available today. Ranging in size, some can measure twenty inches long and weigh in at fifteen pounds. The average papaya found in markets weighs one-and-one-fourth to two pounds and is six to twelve inches long. The Mexican variety is somewhat larger.

Nutritional Value
Papaya places first among fruits in the content of vitamin C, vitamin A, iron, niacin, calcium, folate, riboflavin, thiamine, potassium and fiber. Papaya contains a beneficial enzyme, papain, that aids digestion. Following papaya in nutritional value, in order, is cantaloupe, strawberry, orange, tangerine, kiwi, mango, apricot, persimmom and watermelon. Eating five daily servings of fruits and vegetables lowers the chances of cancer. A recent study found that eating nine or ten daily servings of fruits and vegetables, combined with three servings of low-fat dairy products, were effective in lowering blood pressure.

Applications
Lacking acidity, enhance flavor with a sprinkle of lemon or lime juice. Cut in half; scoop out seeds; top with a scoop of sour cream, frozen or chilled yogurt or ice cream; sprinkle with brown sugar or granola. Slice peeled papaya into rings for an attractive edible garnish; serve with fish and meats. Dress up green salads. Make yummy marinades, ice cream, sauces, smoothies and bread. Add green papaya to stews and soups. Bake, boil or stuff; serve as a vegetable. Add to fruit salads. Puree to make delicious iced beverages. Blend with peanut butter for a tasty spread. Spicy foods love its company. Containing papain, a meat tenderizer, puree fruit to make a natural tenderizing addition to meat marinades. Papaya leaves wrapped around meat also serve as a tenderizer. To soften and tenderize thick meats such as roast beef or t-bones, spread mashed papaya over the meat. Refrigerate about two hours before cooking. To ripen, keep green fruit at room temperature three to five days. To store, refrigerate ripe papaya. Use within a day or two for best flavor. Firm peeled papaya can be frozen in chunks. Frozen fruit is best used in soups, marinades, salad dressings, entrée or dessert sauces and for baking. Uncooked papaya does not congeal in commercial gelatin with an animal protein base. It may be used with agar, a seaweed base. When making papaya chutney or jam, use a commercial pectin or other fruits that have an abundance of pectin.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The Hawaiian Islands are also major producers of papaya and at one time they used this fruit to feed chickens and pigs! Today, it is a favorite on many menus and more mainland consumers are discovering this island delicacy. Papaya is not to be confused with "pawpaw", the American custard apple. Australians use "pawpaw" to mean papaya.

Geography/History
A New World fruit, papaya is native to South and Central America. Its name is derived from the Spanish adaptation of the word "ababai" from pre-Columbian communities in the Caribbean. Dating back to prehistoric times, dozens of varieties of papaya exist today. Mexican papaya grows in Mexico and is imported into the United States.

Passionfruit
Description/Taste
Purple passionfruit is a small, oval to round shaped fruit, approximately two to three inches in diameter at maturity. The fruit's skin is smooth, yet dimpled and at peak maturity can be heavily wrinkled. The skin's color varies with hues of dark purple and red. Below the skin is a cottony white peel. The interior seed cavity is filled with edible yellow to green jelly and medium sized black seeds. Its pulp is highly aromatic and has a tropical sweet tart flavor with nuances of pineapple, papaya, mango, citrus and guava.

Seasons/Availability
Passionfruit is available year-round with peak season winter through summer.

Current Facts
Passionfruit, also known as Granadilla is of the family Passifloraceae. There are several varieties of passionfruit but the two main commercial types on the market today are the Purple passionfruit (Passiflora edulis L.) and Yellow passionfruit (P. edulis f. flavicarpa).

Nutritional Value
The pulp of the passionfruit is rich in Vitamins A and C and its edible seeds are an excellent source of dietary fiber. Its pulp has also been found to be rich in phytochemicals aka antioxidants, which have been shown to help to prevent certain cancers and support a healthy immune system. The flower of the passionfruit has been used for centuries by many cultures as a medicinal supplement to treat insomnia, asthma, anxiety and menopause. The inner white rind of the passionfruit is currently being studied as well for its ability to reduce asthma symptoms and alleviate the pain caused by osteoarthritis.

Applications
Purple passionfruits are prized for the jelly like pulp they contain, which can be used raw or cooked in a number of dessert and beverage preparations. Slice in half and use a spoon to remove the gelatinous contents. Both the pulp and seeds are edible and ready to eat as is, for a less tart flavor add a little sugar and cream to it before serving. Serve passionfruit atop salads, ice cream or yogurt. To remove the seeds squeeze the inner contents of the fruit through cheesecloth. The seed free pulp of the passionfruit can be cooked down to make syrup for use in beverages, sauces, soups, preserves, sherbets, pie fillings, frostings, marshmallows and cakes.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The vines of the passionfruit produce large white flowers with intricate purple, green, black and yellow detailing. It is from these flowers that the passionfruit gets its name as Spanish missionaries felt the appearance of the flower had a resemblance to some of the symbolism found in the Passion of the Christ (the three stigmas as the three nails, the corona as the crown of thorns, the five stamens as the five wounds, the five petals and five sepals as the ten apostles and the purple petals as the purple robe).

Geography/History
The Purple passionfruit is a subtropical fruit native to southern Brazil, Paraguay and Northern Argentina. In the late 1800’s they were also found to be growing in the coastal areas of Australia then soon after made their way to Hawaii via seeds brought over from Australia. It grows vigorously as a vine and is able to stretch its branches across trellises, walls and the canopies of rainforest trees. Passionfruit thrives in warm to hot climates that experience moderate rainfall and rare frost. Commercial production today comes out of India, New Zealand, the Caribbean, Brazil, Columbia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Peru, Australia, Israel, Africa and in the United States from Florida and California.

Peach
Description/Taste
Yellow peaches are the quintessential peach. They are distinguished by their fuzzy thin skin with hues of red, pink and gold blushing throughout. The flesh is aromatic, juicy when ripe, and golden colored with red bleeds at the skin and surrounding the central rough surfaced rust colored pit.  They are often identified as a traditional "true" peach, meaning the fruit exudes a classic peach flavor, balancing sugar and acid for a well-rounded flavor.

Seasons/Availability
Peaches are available year-round, with a peak season in late spring through summer.

Current Facts
Peaches, botanical name, Prunus Persica, are a stone fruit and species within the genus, Prunus, alongside cherries, apricots, plums and almonds.  There are hundreds of varieties of peaches, ranging from heirloom to hybrid. There are two different colors of peaches: yellow fleshed, known as golden and white-fleshed, known as silver.  Peaches are also classified as clingstone or freestone, signaling to whether the fruit's pit hugs its flesh or is easily removed. Most yellow-fleshed peaches are clingstone varieties while white-fleshed peaches fall into the freestone category.  The greatest difference between the two is really about texture and taste.  Clingstone varieties tend to lean on the side of extremely juicy and flavor forward making them very suitable for baking and canning while freestone varieties are generally less succulent and thus chosen for fresh eating.

Applications
Peaches are great for fresh eating, poaching, baking, grilling and processing into jams, syrups, ice creams and preserving in syrup. They can be utilized for fresh fruit salads, for savory salads and appetizers and for desserts such as cakes and pies. Complimentary pairings include other stone fruits, honey, egg custards, lavendar, lemon, orange, cardamon, basil, arugula, cayenne, pepitas, marcona almonds, mascarpone, burrata, chevre, vanilla, white chocolate, yogurt, hazelnut, pistachios and olive oil.

Geography/History
All peaches are native to China, where the only wild peaches still grow today.  Documentation of the first cultivated peach was recorded in Chinese manuscripts as early as the 10th Century BC. Peaches were then brought via the Silk Road to the Fertile Crescent, which is now modern day Iran.  Global trade has brought peach tree cultivation into both the Northern and Southern hemispheres which experience opposite summers and winters allowing for year round availability.  Regions and seasons do determine peach production. Peach trees require wet winters and hot dry summers and will not flourish in Oceanic climates.

Asian Pear
Description/Taste
Asian pears vary in color from golden yellow to russeted green and are often times speckled with small brown spots. Additionally Asian pears can vary in shape and size, the  most commonly grown in the United States are Japanese varieties which have a round squat shape similar to that of an apple. Less commonly grown are the Chinese varieties, which have a more traditional pear shape with bulbous bottom and elongated top, similar to that of European pears. Prized for their crunchy texture the creamy white flesh of the Asian pear is exceptionally juicy with a sweet low acid flavor and fragrant aroma. Unlike regular pears Asian pears are sold ripe and maintain their crisp texture long after being picked. Careful handling must be practiced when picking, packing and transporting Asian pears as their delicate skin bruises and becomes discolored easily.

Seasons/Availability
Asian pears are available year-round.

Current Facts
There are thousands of different known varieties of Asian pears, each varying slightly in shape and color. All Asian pears today are relatives of Pyrus ussuriensis (Ussuri pear) and Pyrus serotina (Japanese sand pear). The Asian pear is known by many names including Nashi, Japanese pear, sand pear and Chinese pear. Though of no relation to apples Asian pears are often referred to as apple pears because of their crisp and juicy apple like consistency.

Nutritional Value
Asian pears are low in calories with about 50 calories per medium sized pear. They are a good source of vitamin C with each pear containing 8% of your daily requirement and provide a fair amount of fiber, most of which is found in the skin. Fiber rich foods such as Asian pears have been show to help lower cholesterol levels and prevent colon cancer. In Chinese medicine Asian pears are considered a cooling fruit and are used for detoxification purposes and to treat coughs, laryngitis, ulcers and constipation. They are also used in Chinese medicine to help promote a healthy complexion, eliminate under eye circles and relieve retina pain.

Applications
The firm and crisp texture of Asian pears make them a popular addition to salads. Add sliced or cubed pear to green and fruit salads or grate and add to coleslaw. Their sweet flavor and juiciness will add moisture and flavor to cakes, pies, muffins and quick breads. Try using as a substitute wherever apples are called for. Chop up and add to holiday stuffing, sauté slices with cinnamon to serve atop pork chops, slow cook to make a sweet sauce or hollow out the core and stuff with dried fruit and nuts for a baked treat. Asian pears will keep a week or two at room temperature and up to three months refrigerated.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
In Asia the culture of the Asian pear can be dated back to the 6th century in a book written by Chia Shi-yi called “Tsee Ming Yau Su” about pear propagation during the 1500 years prior to the books completion. During the Edo period in Japan pears were believed to ward off evil and misfortune and were often planted near gates and in the corner of properties for protection.

Geography/History
Asian pears are native to Japan and China where they have been grown for over 3000 years. The first documented appearance of an Asian pear in the United States was recorded in 1820 when a Chinese sand pear was imported to Flushing, New York. In the mid 1800’s Asian pears made their way to the west coast by way of Chinese and Japanese Immigrants relocating to California after the Gold Rush. Today Asian pears are grown not only throughout Asia but in Italy, Spain, Australia, France, Chile and New Zealand as well. In the United States the bulk of commercial production comes from California and Oregon with a smaller supply coming out of Washington State, Kentucky and Alabama.

Bosc Pear
Description/Taste
Bosc pears are a large variety with a long curved stem and an elongated neck that gradually ends in a rounded bottom; a “true pear” shape. Bosc pears have a golden russet-colored skin. The creamy, off-white flesh is tender yet crisp with an intense honeyed aroma. Bosc pears have a pleasantly sweet flavor with hints of fall spices. The flesh of a Bosc pear may be dense, but it is also quite juicy. To check for ripeness, press the base of the stem to see if the flesh gives a bit. Bosc pears will ‘give’ slightly less than other pear varieties. Occasional wrinkling can be found at the base of the stem when Bosc pears are ripe. These European pears are typically achieved full flavor and juiciness earlier in the ripening process than most other pears and can be enjoyed before the flesh softens.

Seasons/Availability
Bosc pears are available in the fall through the early spring.

Current Facts
Bosc pears are a winter variety of Pyrus communis, commonly known as the European pear. For centuries artists have chosen Bosc pears for their paintings and drawings because of their true pear shape and unique warm, russet skin. Bosc pears are known throughout Europe by many different names, those names carried with them around the world. The shapely pears are known as Beurré Bosc for their ‘buttery’ flavor and Calabasse Bosc for its gourd-like shape, they are also called Kaiser Alexander in some countries.

Applications
Bosc pears can be enjoyed fresh, baked or even dried. When eaten fresh, they are best at room temperature. A common misconception is that Bosc pears must be peeled or cooked before being consumed, which is neither true nor necessary. Bosc pears stand up to cooking and retain their shape, making them ideal for tarts, pies and poaching. Grill halved Bosc pears and top with gorgonzola cheese and chopped walnuts. The flavor of Bosc pears isn’t overwhelmed by strong spices or other flavors. Add sliced Bosc pears to salads or cheese boards, or pair with roasted meats like chicken or pork. As with other pear varieties, ripen Bosc pears at room temperature and refrigerate up to a week.

Geography/History
The origin of Bosc pears is not truly known, confusion exists over whether they are native to France or Belgium. It is believed that the Bosc pear was raised from a seed in 1807 Belgium by M. Bosc, the Director of the Paris Botanical Garden. He named the pear Buerré Blanc, for its buttery texture and after himself. During the early 1800s in Europe, fruit was named for one of its characteristics (flavor, appearance) and its place of origin or the name of the person who discovered the fruit. Bosc pears are also known in some parts of Europe as Beurré d'Appremont, named for a French town. Bosc pears were first planted in the United States in the early 1830s and were first harvested in 1836. Originally planted in the Eastern part of the country, they now thrive in Oregon and Washington State in the Pacific Northwest United States.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bartlett Pear
Description/Taste
Bartlett pears are the only pears that have a “true” pear (or pyriform) shape and taste. The fruit’s color brightens as it ripens, which is a characteristic unique to Bartlett pears; most pears do not change color when ripe. At harvest they are a vibrant green, changing to yellow when ready to eat. When unripe, the texture can be gritty. The Bartlett pear has a distinct flavor and sweetness, its white flesh has a smooth, buttery texture.

Seasons/Availability
Bartlett pears are available year-round; however their peak season is during the fall and winter months.

Current Facts
Bartlett pears are the most popular variety of European pear, known scientifically as Pyrus communis, in the world. Pears are members of the rose, or Rosaceae family. In the United States, Bartlett pears are the first variety to be harvested during the fall season.

Nutritional Value
Bartlett pears are a good source of vitamin C and fiber.

Applications
Bartlett pears can be eaten fresh, out-of-hand, or paired with cheese. They add a sweet flavor to salads and make excellent preserves, syrups, and chutneys. Bartlett pears are known as the “canning pear” because they have a distinct flavor and sweetness which preserves well. They make great additions to cakes, muffins, crisps and quick breads. Bartlett pears are also delicious dried or sautéed to compliment pork dishes. To ripen let sit at room temperature for a few days or in a paper bag to expedite the process, ripe Bartlett pears keep best in the refrigerator.

Geography/History
Bartlett pears are also known as the Williams, or Williams’ Bon Chrétien’ pear outside of the United States. They were discovered in England in 1765 and were introduced to the rest of England by a nurseryman named Williams. At the end of the 18th century Williams pear trees were imported to Massachusetts and planted on the Brewer estate. The estate was acquired by Enoch Bartlett, who later propagated and introduced the pear under his own name. Twenty-five years after it was introduced in the US, it was discovered that the Bartlett and the Williams were one in the same. Today, more than 95% of the pears sold in the United States are grown in Washington, Oregon or Northern California.

Fuyu Persimmon
Description/Taste
The Fuyu persimmon is an improved variety that benefits from a trifecta of qualities; it lacks a core, seeds, and tannins (tannins equate to an astringent persimmon). Fuyu persimmons have a squat and rounded beefsteak tomato like shape and are capped with an indented leaf on their stem end. Fuyu boasts pumpkin colored tones in both skin and flesh and when ripe possess layers of flavor reminiscent of pear, dates and brown sugar with nuances of cinnamon. Their texture varies from crisp and succulent when young to more tender as they mature. Fruits are ready for harvest when skins are deep orange and unlike most other persimmon types have no astringency and are ready to eat when still firm.

Seasons/Availability
Fuyu persimmons are available from mid-fall through the winter months.

Current Facts
Fuyu persimmons, botanically known as part of Diospyros kaki, are an Oriental persimmon, a category of persimmons divided into two types; astringent and non-astringent. Fuyu are the most widely cultivated persimmon in the world and the leading non-astringent persimmon on the market, allowing for them to be eaten fresh out of hand at various times during maturation. Astringent persimmons, which will require being fully ripened prior to eating, are too fragile for shipping which lowers the commercial value of the fruit within a globally distributed food culture.

Nutritional Value
Fuyu persimmons contain significant amounts of fiber and vitamin A. Additionally they contain vitamin C and trace amounts of vitamin E, K and B-6.

Applications
Fuyu persimmons are often used as a substitute or in tandem with apples and pears, as their texture is crisp yet tender and flavor, sweet. Though there are other varieties better suited for preserving and jamming, Fuyus are considered the most versatile persimmon because of their ability to be used both when just ripe and when fully ripe. They can be eaten fresh out of hand or added to cold appetizers, salsas, and salads. They can be sliced and used as a topping for pizza, pies, tarts, yogurt, and toast. Cooked down and pureed Fuyu can be used to make persimmon cakes, breads, puddings, ice cream, and pie filling. Complimentary ingredients include cranberries, pomegranates, ginger, vanilla, nutmeg, cream, brown sugar, maple, soft and fresh cheeses such as mozzarella and mascarpone, pecans, pistachios, bacon, prosciutto, figs, mild lettuces and bitter greens, herbs such as basil, arugula and mint, citrus, balsamic vinegar and nut oils such as hazelnut and walnut. Fuyu persimmons can be kept at room temperature, they can also if preferred be refrigerated. In either scenario be sure not to store near apples or other ethylene producing fruits since they are ethylene sensitive and will ripen and spoil quickly when exposed.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
When in season the persimmon is a prized fruit in many parts of the world. In Greek Fuyu persimmon’s botanical name, Diospyros means “divine fruit”.  In Japan, persimmons are considered to be the country’s national fruit and the Fuyu is also known as Fuyugaki. In the United States persimmons of the Diospyros virginiana variety were introduced to the colonists by Native Americans who taught the colonists how to use the fruit to make puddings and bread. Today in the United States the popular Fuyu is now used in these two traditional American persimmon preparations. In the United States, the Fuyu persimmon makes up nearly eighty percent of the persimmon market nationally.

Geography/History
Persimmons have been cultivated for over a millennia in Asian countries and have long been an important fruit crop there, so much so that it is said that persimmons are to Asia as apples are to America. While persimmons of the group Diospyros virginiana had already been grown for some time in America Oriental type persimmons such as the Fuyu were first introduced to the United States in 1856 by Commander M.C. Perry. Commander Perry brought the seeds back from an American naval fleet visit to Japan, unfortunately none of the seeds planted upon return made it to maturity. Soon after this first attempt the U.S. Department of Agriculture imported seeds for a variety of different Oriental persimmons including the Fuyu from Asia. Since that time, many different types of Fuyu have been developed, and the Fuyu stands today as the most highly cultivated and commercially successful persimmon type. China produces upwards of three million tons annually of persimmons and is the leader in worldwide production. In the United States the Fuyu persimmon is grown predominately in California, specifically in the central San Joaquin Valley as well as in San Diego, Riverside and Orange County.

Pineapple
Description/Taste
Pineapples are cone like in shape and covered in a hexagonal patterned, rough and waxy rind. The rind is green to yellow in color and covered in spiked protuberances. The fruit is topped with a sprout of narrow, pointed, green leaves. Modern cultivars are seedless and produce smoother leaves compared to the wild species that have thorny-edged serrated leaves. The juicy flesh of the Pineapple can vary from white to yellow depending on variety and offers a sweet, succulent flavor and mild acidity.

Seasons/Availability
Pineapples are available year-round with peak production in the spring.

Current Facts
Pineapple, botanical name Ananas comosus, is a herbaceous perennial and member of the family, Bromeliaceae. The fruit of the Pineapple is actually made up of a compound of flowers, an occurrence that is known as a syncarp. There are hundreds of pineapple varieties most of which are grouped into four main classes, Smooth Cayenne, Red Spanish, Queen, and Abacaxi.

Nutritional Value
Providing dietary fiber, pineapples offer a source of vitamin C, some iron and calcium. Just under four ounces of fresh pineapple contains about 60 calories.

Applications
Pineapple are ripe when they are slightly soft to the touch and give off a sweet aroma. To prepare pineapple, cut off top and leaves, then slice skin off. Slice thick pieces from the core or cut horizontally into discs and core. Fresh pineapple can be baked into sponge cakes or coffee cakes, roasted with soy or brown sugar, or skewered and grilled. Puree and strain juice, then add to cocktails or agua fresca. Cooked and sweetened pineapple can be used as a topping for custards, flan and cheesecake. Blend pineapple with other tropical fruits and freeze into sorbet or sherbet. Dice fresh pineapple with tomato herbs and chiles for salsa and serve with seafood. Pineapples will ripen at room temperature, refrigerate to store.

Geography/History
For thousands of years, Central American communities cultivated pineapples found in the wild. European art quickly took to the pineapple motif. Knobs on pew ends were even carved in the shape of the pineapple. The fruit found its way to the Philippines and China by the end of the sixteenth century. Today Hawaii is renowned for the cultivation of producing exceptional pineapple. Several varieties grow in Central America and in the Caribbean. Some supplies are imported from Honduras, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. Pineapples also thrive in China, South Africa, India, Madagascar and the Philippines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Plantain
Description/Taste
Black plantains are distinguished by their stage of maturity and their thick dark peel which encases a starchy and dense pink to pale yellow-hued flesh. They have a sticky texture and strong aromatics of vanilla and true nuances of banana. Only through cooking can the rich depth of sweetness come through in a plantain. Plantains are slow to ripen, commonly taking up to three weeks to become fully ripe.

Seasons/Availability
Plantains are available year-round.

Current Facts
Plantains, botanical name Musa paradisiaca, are the fruit of the same species is as bananas as there are no clear distinctions between bananas and plantains other than bananas are for fresh eating and platains are considered cooking bananas. Those not familiar with the culinary attributes of plantains often view them as looking too black, too green or too bruised. However, that is exactly how they are to look during their different stages of edible use.

Nutritional Value
Plantains are considered a super food. They have more than twenty times the amount of vitamin A, about three times the vitamin C, double the magnesium, and almost twice the potassium as the common banana.

Applications
Black plantains are steeped in the ethnic cooking of Latin and Caribbean cuisines. Black plantains excel as a supporting ingredient to enhance the flavor and depth of other ingredients such as chicken, beans, pork and seafood. Complimentary pairings include pineapples, mango, chiles, brown sugar, mellow melting cheeses, avocados, spices such as cumin, curry, pepper and tumeric, cilantro, coconut and cream.

Geography/History
Plantains are native to Southeast Asia, South Asia and West Africa, specifically tropical regions of Nigeria and Ghana. Plantain plants do eventually expire production of fruit, yet they are among the longest producing of banana plants. A single plant may produce fruits up to fifty years depending on its tropical location.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plum
Description/Taste
All plums share three common characteristics: thin skin, a single central pit and a succulent flesh when ripe.  Colors vary depending on variety. Fruits can be deep purple, rose-hued, ruby red, green and gold.  The shape of plums is generally rounded with a central groove running longitudinal to the fruit's stem end. Flavors vary from sweet-tart to spicy and sub acid. Flesh consistency can vary from tender firm to having a melting quality. All plums continue to ripen once harvested.

Seasons/Availability
Plums are available during the summer.

Current Facts
Plums are a stone fruit and members of the Rosaceae family and classified under the genus, Prunus, along with peaches, cherries, almonds and apricots.  There are three species of plums, Japanese (P. salicina) European (P. domestica) and American (P. americana). Fruits vary in shape, size, flavor, and color according to cultivar. Subspecies include Damsons, Bullace and Greeengage. All plums share the same percentage of naturally occurring sugars, which is 10%.  However fruit breeding since the 19th century has increased plum cultivars' sugar content to reach above 20%. The benchmark plum variety is the Santa Rosa plum, a Japanese plum developed in America by Luther Burbank in 1906. Plums' greatest offspring is perhaps the pluot, a plum-apricot hybrid created to meet the demands of evolving palates.

Applications
Plums are a versatile culinary ingredient with possible uses centuries old.  They can be used for fresh eating, preserved using various methods, including pickling and of course, they can be dried to prune form. Plums can be used as a salad ingredient, as a compote for savory applications, used as the principle ingredient in desserts such as cakes, crumbles and ice creams and they can even be the base for a summer vinaigrette. Plums have a wide array of culinary pairings that are both savory and sweet.  Such pairings include anise, arugula, basil, cherries, chiles, cinnamon, cream, dates, figs, chocolate, nectarines, peaches, citrus, pork, lamb, aged and fresh cheeses, lettuce greens, almonds, pistachios, grilled scallops, brandy, red wine and light-bodied vinegars.

Geography/History
Japanese plums have origins in China but were first domesticated in Japan.  European plums evolved as a hybrid of the cherry plum and wild blackthorn (the wild plum of Europe and western Asia). American plums are native to North America. Each species is responsible for the hybridization of thousands of plum subspecies and varieties. All plums grow on flowering shrub-like trees that blossom in the spring, produce fruit in the summer and shed their foliage in the winter months.  Trees can reach up to 10 meters in height depending on variety. Plum trees are grown by grafting budwood onto rootstock. A common tree chosen for rootstock is the Cherry plum.  It is especially used for European varieties. Other common rootstock varieties include St. Julien, Pixy and the most versatile and hardy, the Viking.

Pomegranate
Description/Taste
Wrapped securely in a thin but tough, leathery, reddish-purple skin, the interior of this fruit is filled with seeds, technically called arils. The seeds of the pomegranate are edible-- each seed is enclosed in a translucent, bright red pulp. The size of an apple, only the seeds and juice are edible offering a sweet-tart taste.

Seasons/Availability
Pomegranates arrive just in time for fall festivals and the holidays. Pomegranates remain available most years through winter.

Current Facts
This fruit is still most popular today in the region of its origin which includes Persia (Iran), southern parts of the the former Soviet Union, India and across Afghanistan to the Himalayas.

Nutritional Value
Providing some vitamin C and the B vitamins plus a moderate amount of fiber, protein and carbohydrates, pomegranates are an excellent source of potassium. Very low in sodium, one fruit contains about 105 calories.

Applications
Pomegranates are most commonly used for their seeds and juice. After separating the seeds from the white pulp of the pomegranate, add to grain or green salads, or mix into sweetened yogurt. Bake seeds into a crisp with fall fruits such as apples or pears. Pomegranate juice can be used to marinate lamb or beef, or reduced into syrup and added to cocktails and smoothies. Cook juice, with sugar, into jam or add to milk or cream and freeze into sorbet and gelato. Pomegranates keep well stored at room temperature for 1-2 weeks.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Pomegranate juice is used to make traditional Persian meat dishes. The seeds are used in India as a sour condiment called "anardana". Italians and children are claimed to be the most notable fans of this fruit in the United States.

Geography/History
Researchers believe it may have been sometime between 4000 B.C. and 3000 B.C. when the first pomegranate trees, pronounced POM-uh-gran-uht, were planted in possibly Northern Iran or Turkey. The name comes from two French words, "pome" and "granate" literally meaning "apple with many seeds". Evidence reveals that Egypt, Jericho and Mesopotamia were the first to domesticate this truly wonderful fruit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pomelo
Description/Taste
The Pomelo is roughly globular to oblate in shape and varies in size and color. Its peel is overwhelmingly thick with a cotton-textured pith. Though the peel is easily removed, it can grow up to five inches deep. The skin is green when young and transforms to a brilliant yellow as it matures. Its pulpy segmented flesh ranges in color tones from pale to rich rosé pink to translucent yellow. The fragrant flesh can be juicy or lean depending on variety and age. Pomelos are semi-acidic, giving them their sweet tart flavor. Most Pomelo varieties contain only a few seeds, though if cross-pollinated with another variety, the fruit will bear multiple seeds.

Seasons/Availability
Pomelos are a winter citrus.

Current Facts
The Pomelo is also known as Shaddock, after its "discoverer". It has many other common names though, as there are at least fifteen different known varieties including Sweetie, Thong Dong and Chandler, one of the most popular varieties of Pomelos. It is the largest and most imposing of all citrus fruits. It has been scientifically linked to the grapefruit as one of its parent fruits.

Applications
Every bit of the heavy pith and membrane must be removed to make this giant gem edible. Cut off ends; score skin; peel away pith and rind. Separate segments, pulling or cutting off the membrane. Serve like grapefruit sections. Pair with seafood, coconut, papaya, peanuts, chile, garlic, and Thai or Asian spices. The thick peel may be candied. To store, refrigerate. Use promptly for optimum quality and flavor.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Pomelo is a staple fruit in Vietnamese food culture and cuisine. It is used for its flesh and its peel, which serves as a vessel for several core culinary preparations.

Geography/History
The Pomelo is native to southeastern Asia and all of Malaysia. Unlike most other citruses, it thrives in tropical lowlands and brackish water conditions. The Pomelo's journey West began with the East Indian ship captain, Shaddock, who first brought the fruit's seeds to the West Indies from the Malay Archipelago in the mid-seventeenth century. Thus, the reference to Shaddock. The Pomelo has little significant commercial crop value in the United States and has limited growing regions throughout Southern California and Florida.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mangosteen
Description/Taste
The Mangosteen fruit is about 3 inches in diameter and roughly rounded with thick leathery leaves attached at the stem end. Its outer shell is thick, smooth, firm and burgundy purple in color. The edible flesh contains an average of five to six snow white triangular segments which can be seedless or contain several flat seeds. The flesh's texture is soft and juicy with a luscious mouthfeel. The fruit has a 16% sugar content and contains volatile compounds which contribute to its floral aromatics and sweet tart tropical flavors with notes of caramel and butter. Ripe fruits will be soft and easy to peel the flesh from the shell.

Seasons/Availability
Mangosteens are available early summer through early winter.

Current Facts
The Mangosteen, botanical name Garcinia magostana, simply referred to as Mangosteen, is an ultra-tropical slow growing evergreen tree that is cultivated for its edible fruit. It belongs to the same genus as the button mangosteen, G. prainiana, and the charichuelo, G. madruno.

Nutritional Value
The Mangosteen's rind is highly valued for its high concentration of the antioxidant, Xanthones. Since 2002, nutritional supplement purveyors have aggressively marketed high-priced Mangosteen juice blends for their anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory properties and ability to combat free radicals and improve immune system.

Applications
Mangosteens are generally scored and peeled in half widthwise to remove the edible flesh from the shell. It is important to carefully remove the flesh as the shell contains a purple excarp juice that can stain upon contact. Mangosteens are eaten fresh out of hand, juiced and dried. They can be frozen or canned but these methods have a tendency to compromise the flavor and favorable texture of the fruit. The Mangosteen is most often utilized as a dessert ingredient in baked goods, custards, ice creams and beverages. Complimentary companion ingredients include, citrus, apples, vanilla, butter, peanuts, pineapples, bananas, kiwis, watermelon and pomegranates.

Geography/History
The Mangosteen is native to Malaysia and Indonesia and is cultivated mainly in Southeast Asia, specifically Thailand, Vietnam and Burma. It also grows on a small commercial scale in 18 countries throughout Central America and the Caribbbean. It has not reached large commercial botanical exploitation due to two main factors: seed germination is difficult and vegetative propagation has proven too often unsuccessful. Its tropical fruit status also limits growing regions where temperatures do not fall below 40ºF and humidity is abundant. Growing limitations alone are not responsible for the fruit's relative obscurity outside of Southeast Asia. The fruit is notorious for harboring insect pests that infect citrus trees, which put Asian Mangosteens on the USDA's forbidden import list for several decades. In 2007, the USDA approved imports of irradiated Mangosteens from Thailand. Mangosteens from Central America and the Caribbean are not irradiated as they do not carry insect pests.

Quince
Description/Taste
Quince resemble a large, lumpy yellow pear with skin that may be smooth or covered with a woolly down depending on variety. A characteristic common to all varieties is their strong aromatic fragrance, a musky-wild, tropical-like perfume. Astringent and sour, the flesh cannot be eaten raw and requires cooking to be edible. The fruit becomes a rich candy-like paste when slowly cooked and turns a deep apricot color with floral honeyed flavors.

Seasons/Availability
Quince is generally available year-round, with sporadic short time gaps. California grown quince (pineapple variety) are harvested in the fall.

Current Facts
Quince are botanically classified as Cydonia oblonga, and are the sole member of its genus. At one time they were considered a staple in kitchens around the world including the United States, but are now mainly found in the East, specifically Turkey and China. This aromatic fruit has now been relegated as a specialty item in most of North American but remains popular in many Latin American countries where as a cooked jelly it is known as dulce de membrillo.

Nutritional Value
Rich in fiber, quince provides a moderate amount of vitamin C and potassium.  Four ounces of raw fruit contains about 65 calories.

Applications
With a high pectin content, quince is ideal for jam, jelly, conserves, fruit leather and candy. Poach quince in wine and vanilla beans. Cook down with sugar until solidified; serve paste, or membrillo, with Spanish cheese such as manchego. Cook with other fall fruits, such as apples or pears, and reduce into compote, or add to spiced cake batter.  Add cooked quince to ice cream custard. Quince is also used in savory preparations, added to beef and lamb stews, or served, cooked slowly, alongside roasts. For longer storage, wrap fruit individually in a double layer of plastic; refrigerate. Place it where it won't be bruised.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
This fruit plays a worldwide confectionary role in Moroccan, Persian, Romanian and Balkan cuisine. Adding quince to meaty stews, the fruit is often a customary accompaniment to roasts. Referred to as "melimelum" by the Romans, this Greek name means "honey apple" because the fruit was preserved in honey for jam. The Portuguese called it "marmelo", a corruption of the word melimelum and enjoy their "marmelado", a favored quince confection. The Greek name "cydonia" became "cotogna" in Italian and "coing" in French. Chaucer wrote of "coines", a word that later became "quince". The British love its bold taste in tarts and pies.

Geography/History
Believed to be native to Iran, its botanical name, Cydonia oblonga, is derived from an area of Crete. Quince cultivation spread to South East Europe and to the Levant even before the apple took root. Around 1000 B.C., researchers say Palestine was familiar with quince and the "apples" mentioned in the Song of Solomon were possibly quinces. The small, twisted quince tree bears fruit of several forms varying in size, color and shape.

Raspberry
Description/Taste
Raspberries are distinguished by their flavor, size, shape and their hollow core. They are an aggregate fruit with individual drupelets that are held together by very fine, nearly invisible hairs. The fruits are petite, roughly oval, plump and vary in flavor from sweet-tart to low acid depending on growing region and coloring. The hollow core is created when the raspberry is separated from its growing receptacle.

Seasons/Availability
Raspberries are available year-round.

Current Facts
Raspberries, botanical name Rubus idaeus, are a bramble fruit of a perennial shrub within the family, Rosaceae (the rose family). There are two types of raspberry plants: summer-bearers, which produce one crop per season and ever-bearers, which produce two crops, one in summer and one in fall.

Applications
Raspberries are most often utilized in sweet applications, though there are plenty of savory recipes for raspberries to embellish. Raspberries are traditionally used as a principle ingredient in fruit salads, jams, ice creams and gelatos. Complimentary pairings include cocoa, exotic fruits, raisins, creamy and bloomy rind cheeses, honey, peaches, coconut, cinnamon, blueberries, cardamom and lavender.

Geography/History
Raspberry bushes are native to the Fertile Crescent, specifically Turkey. They were transported by the Romans to Europe. There are also Raspberry bushes that have origins within the New World of North America. Raspberries are a globally important commercial fruit crop and they are cultivated in all temperate regions of the World. They have an inherent preference to grow in cooler climates, though, thus they do not thrive in tropical regions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sapodilla
Description/Taste
Sapodillas are round to almond in shape and when mature are around three to five inches long and two to four inches wide. The skin is inedible and is smooth and covered in a fuzzy brown coat. When ripe its flesh is yellow orange to red brown in color with a soft and juicy texture. The center of the fruit contains a seed cavity, which holds between three and twelve smooth and flat brown seeds. The seeds are also inedible. A Sapodilla’s flavor is sweet due to the existence of high quantities of fructose and sucrose. Its texture and flavor has been compared to that of pear. Sapodillas should be allowed to ripen at room temperature and are ready to eat when firm with a slight give to them, similar to that of a ripe mango.

Seasons/Availability
Sapodilla are available in spring time and can be found online from small farms that ship their specialty fruit or possibly at a local farmers market.

Current Facts
Sapodilla, botanically known as Manilkara zapota, is also known as Chico sapote, Zapotillo, Chicle, and in India is known as Chikoo. The Sapodilla tree is a slow growing evergreen and has long been cultivated not only for the tropical fruit it produces but for the latex extracted from the bark of the tree known as chicle, an ingredient that is commonly used to make chewing gum.

Nutritional Value
Chikoo as it is known in India is used for its anti-inflammatory benefits. It is also a good source for dietary fiber. In Indian medicinal practices it is used for its anti-viral, and anti-bacterial properties as well.

Applications
Sapodillas are most commonly enjoyed fresh, simply served halved and the flesh eaten straight from the skin. They are excellent chilled or at room temperature. Sapodilla flesh can be used in both fruit and green salads. Puree cooked or raw Sapodilla to make sauces and syrups. Add pureed fruit to custards, puddings and whipped cream. Add to batter for pancakes, muffins and quick breads. Slice and use in a tart or pie. Be sure to remove the seeds before serving. Once ripe keep Sapodillas in the refrigerator and use within a week.

Geography/History
Sapodilla trees are believed to be native to Southern Mexico and the Yucatan. They have been grown throughout Central America since ancient times and can also be found growing in the West Indies, Bermuda, the Philippines and the Florida Keyes. Today India and Mexico rank highest in regards to land acreage devoted to cultivation. Sri Lanka, Venezuela, Guatemala and the Philippines also contribute significantly to the commercial supply. Sapodilla trees prefer warm and sunny locations and will do well in both humid and dry climates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sapote
Description/Taste
The White sapote is a fruit that must be handled with care from cultivation to harvest. The ideal White sapote fruit is rounded or somewhat oval, averaging roughly 3 to 4 inches in diameter.  The skin is thin, lime to lemon lime green in color and lightly coated with a thin bloom.  The flesh is filled with vanilla aromatics, ivory in color with yellow tones near the skin and surrounding the seeds within the flesh.  Any given fruit can bear one to six plump hard inedible and potentially toxic seeds.  The flavor of the fruit is nectar sweet with notes of banana and pear, its texture tender and custard-like.  Less ideal White sapotes will have bitter tones offsetting the fruit's sweetness and the flesh can become pasty and resinous if picked too early, picked poorly or allowed to mature too long.  The level of pollination and weather conditions can also affect the fruits' appearance, flavor and texture.  It is not rare to have entire fruit trees void of pollination, creating fruits with no seeds at all.  Mature fruits are picked with the stem still slightly attached to the fruit to prevent bruising.  The stem eventually falls off, revealing the fruit's peak ripeness.

Seasons/Availability
Sapote fruit is generally available in the fall and winter months.

Current Facts
The name sapote actually refers to several cultivars including the highly regarded fruit, mamey sapote.  There are Black sapote cultivars and in this case, the White sapote, which is the singular sapote fruit to belong to the Rutaceae family.  The White sapote, known as zapote Blanco in its native region, is the most common sapote fruit and a distant relative of the citrus family.  The White sapote fruit is cultivated and sold strictly as a fresh market fruit as it does not ship well.  It is not sold commercially for post-harvest processing either as it has been classified as not suitable for canning, freezing or puréeing, specifically because of its low acid content.

Applications
White sapote fruit is quintessential in Latin American cuisine.  In its native regions, it is most commonly eaten fresh out-of-hand.  The addition of cream and sugar is also very common.  The fruit is chilled or frozen to make a simple custard, blended drink (smoothie) or ice cream.  These simple embellishments prove that the fruit needs very little processing or companion ingredients for it to be purely enjoyed.  It is highly recommended to remove the skin and seeds before eating.

Geography/History
The common White sapote is found indigenously growing wild and cultivated in Central Mexico.  It is also grown in subtropical high elevation regions of Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica.  In Central America the White sapote trees are planted as a shade tree on coffee plantations. The White sapote does not like heavy desert conditions nor does it tolerate too much humidity.  It prefers acidic soil and has greedy roots, often reaching up to fifty feet long. The White sapote was introduced to California in 1810, yet the state's mostly temperate fruit growing regions do not readily accommodate the classic White zapote varieties, often producing less than edible fruits. There have been decades of research and hundreds of acres of Southern California orchards dedicated to developing successful new varieties of White sapote (Chestnut, Suebelle, Chapman, Bravo and Vinner) which can produce more fruits than can be physically eaten.  Regardless, the White sapote's horticultural relevance remains minor within America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shea Fruit
Description/Taste
Shea fruit resembles a small green plum and consists of an oil rich nut surrounded by a thin, tart layer of fruit. The fruit is mildly sweet with a texture of ripe pear and is an important source of energy to local people. Shea butter has a mild, nutty flavor and is common in Sahelian cuisine.

Seasons/Availability
Shea trees produce their fruit throughout a regions rainy season.

Current Facts
Vitellaria paradoxa, or Shea, is a deciduous tree native to Africa. Resembling an oak tree, a Shea tree takes 10-15 years to begin bearing fruit, reaching maturity at 20-30 years, and continues to produce fruit for up to 200 years. It can grow to a height of 15-25 meters. The fruit surrounds a relatively large and oily nut that is used to make Shea butter, a product that is locally consumed or exported as a cosmetic ingredient.

Nutritional Value
The pulp surrounding the nut has significant amounts of carbohydrates, protein and fat as well as vitamins and antioxidants. The kernel within is rich in fat (42-48%), with both vitamins A & E, cinnamic acid (which provides UV protection), and has demonstrated both anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties.

Applications
Shea butter is used as a cooking oil and as a skin product. The leaves, fruit, and bark are used in a variety of applications including medicine and food. Once the fruit ripens, the thin green layer surrounding the inner kernel can be eaten raw or cooked. The nuts are then dried, cracked, cooked and processed into Shea butter which can keep for months or even years. The wood is hard and reportedly termite resistant; it is used for lumber and to make charcoal. The blossoms and fruit are processed into local medicines treating a variety of ailments including arthritis, congestion, and gastric pain.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Africans have been consuming both the fruit and the nut of the Shea tree for centuries. Europeans discovered the properties and benefits of Shea and began importing the nut and its products. Both farmed and wild trees are subject to the collection of the fruit and the nuts. Typically the nuts are gathered and processed by women and children in rural areas, providing an important source of income for these otherwise underserved populations.

Geography/History
The Shea tree grows in the savannah belt of sub-Saharan Africa. It is found in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Togo, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Guinea.

Snake Fruit
Description/Taste
Snake Fruit have a shape similar to that of a fig. Snake fruit has a scaly outer skin that is sometimes covered in tiny spikes. Snake fruit purchased in markets is typically smoothed. Most varieties of Snake fruit have dark brown skin when mature and have a bulbous appearance that tapers to a point at one end. Beneath its scaly skin lies three white to yellowish colored lobes that look similar to large cloves of peeled garlic. Each lobe contains a hard brown, inedible seed. The texture of Salak fruit is similar to that of garlic, crunchy and crisp. The flavor is tropical, with hints of pineapple with a slightly acidic taste. Some varieties are drier and have a flaky consistency while some Snake fruit are moist and juicy. Some say Salak fruit is an acquired taste.

Seasons/Availability
Snake fruit is harvested and sold year-round in Southeast Asia.

Current Facts
The Snake fruit, also known as Salak in Malaysia and Indonesia, is a fruit in the Arecaceae or palm family. The small fruit is wildly popular in Bali and India, just as apples and oranges are in the US, yet it is rarely seen outside of its native region. Snake fruit is also known as Salacca Fruit, after its botanical name ‘Salacca Zalacca’, and has over 30 known varieties.

Nutritional Value
Snake fruit is called the Fruit of Memory in Indonesia due to its levels of potassium and pectin. It contains nutrients like thiamine, iron and calcium as well as vitamin C. The Indonesian fruit has anti-diarrheal properties; if too many Snake fruit are consumed it can result in constipation.

Applications
To eat, remove the stem and peel back the scaly brown skin. Each lobe within is covered in a white film, similar to that on the outside of a hardboiled egg. Be sure to remove the layer of film before eating. Most Snake fruit is eaten fresh, out-of-hand as a snack. The sweetly sour flavor compliments pies and jams. Snake fruit can be candied or pickled or made into syrup. One variety of Snake fruit, Salak gula pasir is fermented into a wine. The pineapple-like scent of the Snake fruit is also used as an aromatic.

Geography/History
Snake fruit are native to Indonesia and Malaysia and can be found growing in Bali, Thailand and India. The name Salak means ‘bark’ in its native regions. The popular fruit is sold in farmer’s markets throughout Southeast Asia. The fruit are used to help poor eyesight and treat digestive maladies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guanabana
Description/Taste
The Guanabana (pronounced gwuh-nah-buh-nuh) is a large, crooked heart-shaped fruit with small spike-like protrusions. The skin is dark-green and turns slightly yellowish-green when ripe. When ready to eat the fruit is very soft to the touch, and begins to break down quickly. The white flesh is custard-like and sweet; the juicy, segmented pulp contains large black seeds. The aroma has been likened to a pineapple or banana, with a uniquely acidic flavor. The shelf-life of this fruit is only a few days at room temperature.

Seasons/Availability
The Guanabana is available year-round, with peak seasons from winter to late fall in various regions of the tropics.

Current Facts
The Guanabana is also known as the Soursop or the Graviola. It is in the genus Annona, and is related to the Sugar Apple and Cherimoya. The fruit is said to be a natural remedy against cancerous cells.

Nutritional Value
Guanabana can be used to fight against bacterial and fungal infections. It is said to be effective at lowering high blood pressure and aiding in depression, stress and nervous disorders. Tea made from the leaves of the Guanabana tree is used as a sleep aid in Trinidad. The seeds are toxic and should be removed before ingesting the pulp or before juicing.

Applications
The Guanabana is most typically used to make a sweet beverage. The fruit is ideal for processing and preservation. The pulp is pushed through a sieve or cheesecloth and the resulting juice is mixed with milk or water and sweetened. The juice can be used to make ice creams, sorbets, mousse, or custards; it also makes a nice cocktail when mixed with alcohol. The pulp can be frozen and eaten or used to create jellies, syrups or nectar.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The Guanabana is made into a carbonated beverage and commercially processed in Puerto Rico. In the West Indies, it is fermented and made into a cider-like drink. In the Philippines it is called guayabano and sold as a vacuum-concentrated juice that is dyed pink or green to make it's milky color more appealing. Various parts of the Guanabana tree have been used for centuries by medicine men and native Indians in South America to treat ailments such as heart disease, asthma, liver problems and arthritis.

Geography/History
The Guanabana was first written about in the 16th century, during which time it was abundant in the West Indies and the northern parts of South America. The Guanabana tree was one of the first fruit trees taken from the Americas to the Old World Tropics. Since then, it can be found in Australia, southern China, Vietnam, and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in the Dominican Republic and is one of the most popular fruits in Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, Colombia and northeastern Brazil. It can also be found growing in Hawaii and southern Florida. In 1951 a Professor in Puerto Rico who was encouraging the development of the Guanabana told a professor of agriculture in the United States that he wanted to adopt a different name for the fruit in the US. He didn’t think the name soursop was very appealing and was concerned Guanabana was too difficult to pronounce. To this day, a better name has not been found.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strawberry
Description/Taste
Strawberries are distinguished by their conical heart shape as well as the texture of their skin and their flavor. All varieties of strawberries have seeds on the skin rather than skin around the seed, which distinguishes them from a berry and a true fruit. The texture of any given strawberry is tender firm when ripe with varied levels of succulence. Leaner strawberries will have a semi cottony mouthfeel while sweeter varieties, with high sugar content, will create a more mouthwatering experience. Flavors also range anywhere from sweet-tart to overtly syrup-sweet.

Seasons/Availability
Strawberries are available year-round.

Current Facts
Strawberries are botanically known as Fragaria x ananassa and are members of the Rosaceae family. Strawberries are not actually botanically classified as a berry, rather they are the greatly enlarged stem end of the plant's flower. There are hundreds of varieties of strawberries, each displaying unique attributes, growing capacities, flavor profiles, resistance to disease, size shape and coloring. Varieties are chosen based on the growing regions in which their greatest characteristics thrive.

Applications
Strawberries are versatile because of their varied sugar content and acidity. Wherever berries are called within a recipe, strawberries can easily be utilized. Strawberries can be used in a variety of preparations; sweet and savory, raw and cooked. They can be eaten fresh out of hand whole, sliced, pureed, cooked down into a compote, syrup or glaze and used within ice creams, gelatos, granitas, sorbets and cocktails. Complimentary pairings include, vanilla, oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes, watermelon, cream, yogurt, ginger, brown sugar, chiles, bacon, cheeses such as blue cheese, feta and chevre, and herbs such as basil, mint, lemon verbena, fennel and lavender.

Geography/History
There are species of strawberry native to temperature regions all around the world. Yet, it was the union of two species native to the Americas that gave us the garden strawberry, hence cultivated strawberries are actually a hybrid. Fragaria virginiana, native to North America, was taken from the New World to France in 1624. Fragaria chiloensis, a wild species of strawberry native to Chile, was also taken to France in 1712. Both species were widely grown in European gardens. Chance seedlings representing crosses between the two species resulted in the modern cultivated strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa. There are three types of modern strawberry cultivars: June-bearing, Everbearing and Day-neutral. June-bearing strawberries are harvested in June, Everbearing strawberries thrive in hotter climates, while Day-neutral strawberries do not respond to day length, rather they flower and fruit for about five months.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sugar Apple
Description/Taste
The Sugar Apple has a thick scaly rind with a creamy, sweet pulp which comes apart in segments each containing a shiny black seed. The more common Sugar Apple is green, though there is a dark red variety that is becoming more commonplace. This knobby fruit has a delicate, creamy white flesh that has a minty or custardy flavor.

Seasons/Availability
The Sugar Apple is available mid-summer into fall.

Current Facts
The Sugar Apple (Annona squamosa), sometimes called a sweetsop or custard apple, is related to the cherimoya. Native to the tropics, the tree that bears this fruit is often a favorite of landscapers in Central America and the southern coast of Florida.

Nutritional Value
Parts of the Sugar Apple, their leaves and leaf extracts, can be used for medicinal purposes to benefit digestive problems and rheumatic pain.

Applications
The Sugar Apple is typically eaten fresh out-of-hand, served raw and chilled, as a dessert, or used to make ice cream or shakes. The fruit is almost never cooked, unless preparing for jellies or preserves. Sliced, this fruit makes a nice addition to a fruit salad. In Malaya, located south of Vietnam, the flesh is typically strained to make a puree to add to ice cream or milk for a shake. Some wine makers ferment the puree and juices into wine. The Sugar Apple is delicate and may come apart when ripe, requiring careful handling.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The seeds of the Sugar Apple are toxic and are often dried and powdered for fish poisons and insecticides in India. A paste made from the seed powder has been used as a lice killer when applied to the head. In India, the ripe fruit is crushed and mixed with salt and the concoction is applied on tumors.

Geography/History
The Sugar Apple is said to be native of Central America or the West Indies. Ancient Indian sculptures depict what appear to be sugar apples, making some believe the tree was indigenous there. Common in the Tropic regions around the world, you’ll also find Sugar Apples in the warmer southeast and southwest coasts of Florida. Jamaican farmers have started growing more orchards of “Jamaican sweetsop” and many locals believe that the Sugar Apple was first found in Jamaica.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gold Tamarillo
Description/Taste
Golden tamarillo fruit is egg-shaped with a glossy tangerine hued skin and succulent flesh containing small soft edible seeds. The skin is thin and far too bitter and tannin rich for palatable human consumption. Its flesh, though, when ripe, is bright and piquant in flavor with a pleasant sweet tart balance.

Seasons/Availability
Tamarillos are available late from fall into winter.

Current Facts
The Golden tamarillo, botanical name Cyphomandra betacea, AKA tree tomato, is a member of the Solanaceae family which includes tomatoes, potatoes, tobacco and pepper plants.

Applications
Not all tamarillos are created equal and some varieties are simply sweeter than others. Regardless, the skin should be removed before eating, which can be done by blanching and peeling or scoring and removing the skin with a kitchen peeler. Another simpler approach is to cut the fruit in half and scoop out its edible flesh. Riper fruits tend to be sweeter and more versatile when pairing with other ingredients. Primary recipes that the tamarillo is chosen for are deserts such as cakes and ice creams, fruit salads and green salads. Common usage of the whole fruit is in beverages where the fruit is blended with milk, sugar and ice. It can also be pureed and frozen or preserved into jam form.

Geography/History
The Golden tamarillo is native to the Andes mountains of Peru. It has been cultivated on Peruvian mountainsides since pre-Columbian times. It is grown on a small scale from Chile to Venezuela. On the Colombian and Ecuadorian uplands, it is found in every city from Bogotá to Quito. Regardless of its widespread cultivation throughout the subtropics, it is still considered a garden variety fruit and has yet to be heavily exploited on a commercial level. During the second half of the 20th century New Zealand established the first commercial level orchard production. Horticulturists selected tree tomato types, developed improved varieties, naturalized the fruit and named it tamarillo in 1967. It was the first country to establish a new standard designated name for the fruit and expand tamarillos into international trade, exporting to Japan, North America and Europe. Tamarillo trees are generally propagated from seed and are self-compatible, requiring no pollination, though bee pollinated flowers improves fruit production.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Tamarillo
Description/Taste
Red tamarillo fruit is petite and teardrop shaped with a glossy smooth cranberry hued skin and succulent flesh containing small soft edible seeds. The skin is thin and far too bitter and tannin rich for palatable raw consumption. Its flesh, though, when ripe, is bright, sweet-tart and piquant in flavor. Red tamarillo varieties have a naturally higher acid content than golden tamarillos.

Seasons/Availability
Red tamarillos are available year-round.

Current Facts
Red tamarillo, botanical name Cyphomandra betacea, AKA tree tomato, is the fruit of a fast growing herbaceous shrub and a member of the Solanaceae family which includes tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, tobacco and pepper plants.

Applications
The singular applicable rule that can be applied to all tamarillos is that the skin should be removed before eating, which can be done by blanching and peeling or scoring and removing the skin with a kitchen peeler. Another simpler approach is to cut the fruit in half and scoop out its edible flesh. Riper fruits tend to be sweeter and more versatile when pairing with other ingredients. Primary recipes that the tamarillo is chosen for are deserts such as cakes and ice creams, fruit salads and green salads. Common usage of the whole fruit is in beverages where the fruit is blended with milk, sugar and ice. It can also be pureed and frozen or preserved into jam form.

Geography/History
Though tamarillos are unknown in the wild state, cultivated varieties are native to the Andes mountains of Peru. The tamarillo has been cultivated on Peruvian mountainsides since pre-Colombian times. It is grown on a small scale from Chile to Venezuela. On the Colombian and Ecuadorian uplands, it is found in every city from Bogotá to Quito. Regardless of its widespread cultivation throughout the subtropics, it is still considered a garden variety fruit and has yet to be heavily exploited on a commercial level. Tamarillo trees are generally propagated from seed and are self-compatible, requiring no pollination, though bee pollinated flowers improves fruit production. Fruits form from branches in clusters and prolific production occurs on trees year-round, thus fruits do not mature simultaneously and multiple harvests are required unless trees are pruned to prevent constant production. One single tree can produce an average of forty pounds of tamarillo per year. This does not guarantee consistent fruit quality or flavor and only through continued horticultural research can variables such as shape, color and sugar:acid ratios be improved.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tangerine
Description/Taste
Tangerines are generally small and flatter than most other citrus. They have dark orange skin that sits loosely on the flesh inside, so they are easy to peel. The flesh is divided into eight to ten segments, which contain juicy and extremely sweet fruit, without the usual acidity of most citrus.

Seasons/Availability
Tangerines are available beginning to late winter.

Current Facts
Tangerines (Citrus reticulata) are a variety of citrus also know as mandarins or satsumas. Popular varieties of tangerines include Clementine and Dancy. There are also many well-known hybrids of tangerines and other citrus, including tangelos and tangors.

Nutritional Value
These fruits are low in calories but high in healthy nutrients like Vitamin C, Vitamin A, calcium, potassium, and fiber.

Applications
Since tangerines are so easy to peel, they are a great choice for on-the-go snacks or children's lunches. Enjoy them as is, or in baked goods, jams, and other desserts. The juice is very sweet and refreshing, while the skin can be candied. Choose fruit that is firm and bright in color rather than soft and dull, and that feels heavy. They store best in the refrigerator for up to a week.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Tangerines are enjoyed all over the world. In fact, they are the second-most produced citrus fruit in the world, after the sweet orange. Around 21 million metric tons are harvested from two million hectares around the globe.

Geography/History
Tangerines originally grew in southeastern China and northeastern India three thousand years ago. They made their way to North America via North Africa. The name tangerine derives from the port of Tangiers in Morocco, where they were first sent to Europe and the United States in the nineteenth century. China still produces the most tangerines in the world, providing almost half of the global supply. Spain, Brazil, and Turkey are also large producers of tangerines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tomatillo
Description/Taste
Tomatillos vary from one inch in diameter to plum-size and resembling the green cherry tomato, the tomatillo, pronounced tohm-ah-TEE-oh, is much more lustrous and much firmer. Tomatillos are enclosed in a wrapper-like husk or calyx, creating an appearance of an oriental lampshade. Easily peeled away, the fruit is inside this web-like and dry parchment-colored covering. Having a unique gelatinous texture, the flesh offers a sweet and spicy flavor with a citric edge. This fruit is most often cooked to develop its excellent flavor. The raw fruit has a sharp acidic taste.

Seasons/Availability
Tomatillos are available year-round.

Current Facts
The tomatillo means little tomato and is just one of nearly one hundred Physalis species. This group has fruits that are commonly enclosed in papery calyxes and are called "Chinese lantern plants"  because of this unusual formation.

Nutritional Value
Low in calories, one cup contains about 95 calories. Tomatillos provide a fair amount of vitamin A and vitamin K.

Applications
Tomatillos are excellent in cooked salsas and sauces. Chop raw for salads, guacamole, gazpacho or use as a garnish for cold soups. Raw slivers enhance sandwiches. Pureed or chopped, tomatillos make for a delicious tart dressing. Onions, cilantro, chili peppers and garlic enhance flavor. To store, place in a paper-lined basket or dish and refrigerate. This fruit keeps exceptionally well. Freeze cooked tomatillos for longer storage. For a convenient sauce-making ingredient, use both liquid and fruit, do not drain.

Geography/History
The tomatillo is also called a Spanish tomato not because it is known in Spain but because it is native to and grows in Mexico. Another name is green tomato as it remains green even when ripe. It is also sometimes referred to as husk tomato or Mexican husk tomato. Traditionally, tomatillos are especially a favored ingredient in New Mexican and Mexican dishes. Easy to grow, tomatillos were a staple food in ancient Mayan and Aztec communities. First introduced into India in the 1950s, it remains very popular there where it is commonly made into chutney.

Ugli Fruit
Description/Taste
Ugli™ fruit, is wrapped in a rough, puffy, slightly loose-fitting greenish-yellow to orange fragrant skin. Ranging in size from an overgrown navel orange to a hefty grapefruit, the nearly seedless pinkish-orange or sunshiny yellow-orange pulp contains tender large juice sacs that offer a soft fleshiness. The fruit is similar to a grapefruit with one important distinction: It is sweet, unlike the grapefruit and does not have a tart after taste. The older the fruit looks on the outside, the sweeter it is on the inside. Its acid-sweet, zesty, pungent flavor is somewhat reminiscent to that of an orange. Some fans say it tastes more like a mandarin with faint overtones of pineapple or honey.

Seasons/Availability
Ugli™ fruit is available from Jamaica on a limited basis typically winter through spring and is best adapted to tropical climates. This unique fruit is available from Florida in early summer.

Current Facts
Ugli™ fruit, botanically known as Citrus reticulate X paradise, was named and trademarked in 1934 when an importer of the fruit specifically ordered "...more of that ugly fruit...". Ugli™ fruit, pronounced OO-gli, is a natural tangelo hybrid between a grapefruit, seville orange and a tangerine. The original Ugli™ fruit importer has used improved scions to create the version of the fruit we know today. Ugli™ fruit is also sold under the moniker Uniq fruit.

Nutritional Value
A good source of vitamin C, Ugli™ fruit is high in fiber.

Applications
Despite its thick skin, this odd looking fruit is easy to peel. Cut fruit holds an abundant amount of wonderful juice. Possibly addicting, sprinkle halves lightly with sugar and let sit for a minute or two. Scoop out fruit with a serrated spoon. Mix sections in fruit and vegetable salads. To enhance flavor, pair with avocado and, remarkably, sweet onions will bring out its best flavor. Bitter herbs and leaves also love to be near this fruit such as chicory and radicchio. Grapes, bananas and strawberries enjoy its company, too. Great in compotes or gelatin molds. Use grated rind as flavoring. Candy the peel for a sweet snack. Refrigerate only if fruit is not to be used within a couple of days. Refrigerated fruit keeps about three weeks.

Geography/History
Ugli™ fruit was discovered growing wild in 1924 by a gentleman named F.G. Sharp at Trout Hall, near Brown’s Town in Jamaica. Ugli™ fruit was developed commercially by the same family which discovered the original tree and was originally marketed as The Exotic Tangelo from Jamaica™. Today, the Ugli™ fruit is grown and exported from Jamaica and Florida.

Seedless Watermelon
Description/Taste
The Seedless watermelon has the same trademark two-toned variegated green skin and juicy, aromatic sweet flesh as the common watermelon. Though devoid of the ubiquitous black seeds of common watermelons, the Seedless watermelon may contain a trace amount of white, edible seeds. Depending on variety and region of cultivation, average weights can range from six to twenty-five pounds. Look for watermelons with nice even color except for a yellow patch (not white or green) where it laid on the ground. Seedless, triploid variety melons are also more prone to flesh that cracks and separates, a condition known as hollow heart.

Seasons/Availability
Seedless watermelons are available year-round with a peak season in the summer months.

Current Facts
A member of the Cucurbitaceae family, Seedless watermelon is botanically known as Citrullus lanatus and is a triploid fruit. They are infertile, resulting from a cross between two plants of incompatible chromosome complements. Though the fruits are seedless, they must be grown from seed. Fruit development is furthered by pollination from a third party fertile watermelon. A rather complicated and costly process finally bears a fruit with no seeds. Seedless watermelons range in flesh color from red to yellow to orange.

Applications
Watermelon is used predominately in fresh preparations both sweet and savory. It works well as a core salad ingredient or can be added alongside savory components such as poultry and seafood. As a result of their lack of seeds the Seedless watermelon is ideal for applications calling for pureed watermelon such as beverages, sorbets, soups and sauces. When considering preserving watermelons the flesh can be made into jams and the rinds, pickled. The lack of seeds allow for easy preparation. They can be sliced, cubed, scooped or formed in to balls. For best flavor and texture keep Seedless watermelons refrigerated.

Geography/History
Watermelon is a member of the cucumber family that originated from the warm climes of tropical and subtropical Africa. Seedless watermelon production began its evolution in 1939. The first specimen were developed by Professor H. Kihara, a Japanese scientist at Kyoto University. Commercial triploid hybrids were available twelve years later, though they didn't create a large market for themselves until the late 20th century. Today, half of the watermelons grown in California are seedless.
