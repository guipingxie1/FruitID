Akebi Fruit
Image link: sppics/9541.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Akebi fruit has a purple color not often seen in nature. It is the size of a russet potato and is soft to the touch. A slice can be removed from the thick rind of a domesticated Akebi fruit, whereas the wild grown fruits must be allowed to split on their own indicating ripeness. Inside of the Akebi fruit is a sweet translucent white flesh (similar in look and texture to a lychee) with a taste somewhat like pear. The flesh is filled with shiny black seeds.

Seasons/Availability
Akebi fruit is only available for two weeks out of the year; its season is at the very beginning of fall.

Current Facts
Akebi fruit is both wild and cultivated. The exotic looking fruit is found in Japan during a very brief period at the end of the summer or early fall. Because of the short availability, distribution is somewhat limited to just a few stores and in limited quantity.

Applications
The inner flesh of the Akebi fruit is usually eaten fresh, slurped from the purple pod. Seeds can be spat out or eaten; it can be difficult to remove them from the gelatinous flesh. The pod itself can be cooked and is used very much like a vegetable in traditional Tohoku cuisine. It is stuffed, sautéed and deep fried. The taste of the rind is bitter; to mellow the flavor, soak the unopened pod in water for thirty minutes to an hour.

Geography/History
Akebi fruit is native to the northern Tohoku region of Japan, and has only been cultivated and available commercially in the last few decades. Research into the Akebi fruit has found that it has antiseptic and diuretic properties.

Apricots Blenheim
Image link: sppics/10834.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Blenheim apricots are known for its golden yellow and blush red bi-coloring on its outer skin. As apricots ripen from the inside out and the Blenheim being a particularly delicate variety, the free stone fruit may have a slight green tinge on the shoulder, yet will still have the full sweet apricot flavor. Blenheims have a thick aromatic flesh with a richer, darker orange color than other varieties. These apricots are known to have a complex yet perfectly balanced sweet-tart flavor with notes of honeysuckle and honey.

Seasons/Availability
Blenheim apricots have a short peak harvest period in mid-summer.

Current Facts
The Blenheim apricot has become synonymous with the varietal names Royal or Blenheim Royal apricot. The botanical name for the Blenheim apricot is Prunus armeniaca “Blenheim.” As recently as 20 years ago the Blenheim was the leading variety grown in California. However, due to the fruit’s propensity to bruise in shipping, competition from imported dried apricots, and the increased urbanization of the growing areas, the cultivation of Blenheims has drastically decreased. Slow Food USA has listed the Blenheim on their Ark of Taste list of endangered crops.

Applications
Blenheims are most commonly used for drying and preserves. Fresh Blenheims are also great for eating out of hand, yet are difficult to find due to their delicate nature. Complimentary flavors include vanilla, nutmeg, tropical fruits, citrus, honey, lavender, and ginger. Savory pairings include mild, fresh cheeses such as chevre and ricotta, brie, herbs such as arugula, chilies, cilantro, jalapeno, sweet onions, basil, pistachios, and fennel. When cooked down into jams or preserves pair well with crepes, scones and other pastries.

Geography/History
The Blenheim has a tangled genealogy that even dedicated fruit historians have difficulty straightening out. One theory traces it back to a seedling planted in the Luxembourg Gardens of Paris, and introduced to the public around 1815 under the name Royal. Then about 20 years after the introduction of the Royal, a seed, supposedly from the Royal tree, was planted in the garden of the Blenheim Palace. The tree thrived and its fruit was called Shipley’s Blenheim, named after the head gardener of the palace. Blenheims were found planted in the Spanish missions of California by the 1880s and reached their height of cultivation during World War I. During the war shipments of dried fruit from Europe came to a halt and demand for apricot trees in California spiked to supply dried apricots for the market. In the 1920s Blenheim orchards covered Santa Clara and Alameda counties and the Sacramento Valley.  However, this variety’s propensity to bruise and crush during harvest and shipping has caused its decline in the more recent history. Blenheims are best grown in the Northern and central valley of California in the foothills to help avoid late spring frosts that can damage early blossoms. The trees require 400 chilling hours before they produce fruit, full sunlight and fast-draining, loamy soils.

Beneath the thin skin, Puebla avocados have a bright green, creamy flesh that is buttery-smooth and rich in flavor. Puebla avocados offer a nutty, earthy flavor with an underlying sweetness. The seed within the Puebla avocado is larger than the common Hass.

Seasons/Availability
Puebla avocados are available in the early spring.

Current Facts
Puebla avocados are a small variety of avocado, closely related to the more well-known Hass. These dark-skinned avocados have been dwarfed by the popularity of other, heartier varieties and the number of trees in existence has dwindled. They were once considered the finest of all the Mexican avocados. The Puebla variety was one of a few varieties responsible for the thriving avocado industry that exists today in Southern California.

Applications
The smooth, buttery taste of the Puebla avocados makes a great guacamole, but can also stand alone on salads or sandwiches. Cut Puebla avocados lengthwise and remove the pit. Scoop out the flesh and spread on slices of toasted baguette and top with mango salsa for a crostini appetizer. Add slices to tostadas or tacos, or simply mash with fresh tomatoes, cilantro and onions.

Geography/History
In 1911, 21 year-old Carl Schmidt, an employee of the West Indian Nursery in Southern California, set off to find the best Mexican avocados with the hope of bringing samples back to the United States. He visited Puebla, a city eighty miles southeast of Mexico City and brought back to the United States what we know today as Puebla avocados. The trees flourished in the Southern California soil and were grown and sold mostly for local consumption. When the commercial market grew for avocados, the thicker skinned Hass avocados shipped better and had greater longevity than the Puebla. Puebla avocado trees were eventually replaced by heartier varieties, until wildfires in San Diego County decimated all but 10 trees. These few remaining trees have been boarded and protected; though some growers in the area are working on reestablishing the variety.

Berries Mulberry White
Image link: sppics/8902.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
White mulberries are identical to their black or red counterparts, with a white, pink or light purple flesh. They resemble elongated blackberries. Compared to Red mulberries, the white variety are smaller, more mildly sweet, and are not as tart. White mulberries have a mild honey taste and are best when slightly overripe.

Seasons/Availability
White mulberries are available during the late spring and summer months.

Current Facts
White mulberries, also known as Morus fruit, from its Latin designation, Morus alba, are technically not berries. It is a multiple fruit, made up of many small fleshy drupes. White mulberries are specially cultivated in China for their color and leaves, which are a silkworm’s preferred snack.

Nutritional Value
White mulberries can be classified as a Super Food, as they are very rich in vitamin C and anthocyanins, which give them their pinkish-purple color.

Applications
White mulberries can be used like any other berries; in pies and tarts, as a garnish for desserts and breakfasts.  Eat them fresh, out-of-hand for a snack or dry them to add to granola or cereals.  White mulberries freeze well for future use.  Make scones or muffins, or puree into a sauce for both sweet and savory dishes.  These Chinese drupes blend well with other fruits, especially apples and pears.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
In China, White mulberries are considered a blood tonic and are used to treat a variety of ailments such as fatigue, anemia, and insomnia.

Geography/History
White mulberries are native to China where they were cultivated for their leaves as a food source for silk worms. The relationship between the White mulberry and the silkworm dates back 4000 years. White mulberry trees typically do not produce white fruit, unless specifically cultivated to do so. They are called “White” for the color of the buds, and not necessarily for the color of their fruit. White mulberry trees that produce purely white fruit are rare. Typical White mulberry trees produce fruit that is white when immature, then more pink or purple as it matures. There are three species of mulberry that exist: white, red and hybrid. The hybrid trees produce fruit of several colors. White mulberries can be found growing in the Mediterranean region, in countries bordering the Caspian and Black Seas. They are also grown by a few farmers in California, specifically for farmers markets and restaurants.

The fruits’ texture has been likened to shaved ice, crunchy and juicy, with a subtle tartness and a floral sweetness similar to sugarcane.

Seasons/Availability
Peruvian Apple Cactus fruit is available in the fall and sporadically throughout the winter.

Current Facts
The Peruvian Apple cactus is also known as Hedge cactus, Giant Club cactus and Night Blooming Cereus. The correct botanically classification is Cereus repandus, though it is sometimes incorrectly referred to as C. peruvianus. The genus name Cereus, is Latin for ‘torch’ perhaps alluding to the brilliant white flowers that bloom at night giving the effect of a flame at the top of its stem. The fruit of the Peruvian Apple cactus may be foraged in the wild or found commercially cultivated, especially in Israel.

Applications
To prepare the fruit of the Peruvian Apple cactus, select firm fruits that have just barely begun to split open and lack any bruising. Peel away the outer skin or cut the fruit in half and scoop out the soft white interior. They are best enjoyed raw and may simply be eaten out of hand or prepared similarly to Dragon Fruit. Dice the flesh and add to salads, smoothies, fruit salsas or desserts.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The Peruvian Apple cactus is fast becoming an important cash crop in Israel where water shortages are an increasing problem for the farming industry. The groves of cacti are now replacing old orchards that once required large amounts of water. The fruits are able to grow year-round and are even exported to Europe where they are known as Koubo fruit.

Geography/History
Despite the name, Peruvian Apple Cactus are actually native to Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. They are a hardy cactus that thrives in hot arid climates but can withstand temperatures down to 20 degrees F. In areas where summers are excessively hot and dry, some irrigation may be necessary especially to induce healthy fruit production.

Gac Fruit, or simply Gac as it is referred to in Southeast Asia, is a tropical vine that is botanically classified as Momordica cochinchinensis. It is also commonly known as Baby Jackfruit, Spiny Bitter Gourd, Sweet Gourd or Cochinchin Gourd. It has an extremely short season, a mere two months long, but the fruit plays an important role in celebratory dishes as well as in natural medicine. Until recently, Gac has been a mystery outside of its native lands, but the juice has since been marketed as a dietary supplement because of its allegedly high phytonutrient content.

Nutritional Value
Gac has an especially high lycopene content, containing up to 70 times the amount of lycopene found in tomatoes. It also has 10 times the amount of beta-carotene found in carrots or sweet potatoes. In Vietnam, the seed membranes are used to aid in eye health.

Applications
The juicy inner pulp of the Gac may be eaten raw on its own or blended with other fruits to make a juice. It is most commonly cooked with sticky rice in a dish called Xoi Gac, in which the fruit’s deep red color and mildly fruity flavor is extracted. The young shoots of the vines are also eaten as a vegetable, simply steamed and paired with nam phrik (chili-based Thai condiment). An unconventional yet delicious way to enjoy the health benefits of Gac is to combine it with tomato sauce and use on a pizza or with pasta.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
During the Vietnamese Tet holiday, Gac is prepared in a festive sticky rice dish called Xoi Gac which is flavored with cinnamon and stained bright red with the fruit’s pulp.

Kraton Fruit
Image link: sppics/12843.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The Kraton tree can reach enormous heights of up to 45 meters tall and produce up 24,000 fruits a year. The round fruit is approximately softball sized and a deep golden color that is sometimes tinged with pink. The semi hard exterior surrounds milky white, juicy pulp that may be scooped away like the interior of a very firm melon. The innermost flesh is cottony in texture and tightly clings to 3-5 hard inedible seeds. Kraton fruits range from quite tart to pleasantly sweet and sour, developing flavors similar to that of a mangosteen, tropical and acidic.

Seasons/Availability
Kraton fruit is available in the fall, domestically; but ripens earlier its native Southeast Asian climate.

Current Facts
Kraton is the Thai name for the fruit botanically classified as Sandoricum koetjape in the Meliaceae, or Mahogany, family. It is perhaps the only significant edible fruit in the entire family, found both wild and cultivated. Commonly known as Santol outside of Thailand, it is sometimes referred to as Wild Mangosteen, Cottonfruit, Sour Apple and Sandorica. There are two general types of Kraton, red and yellow, both varying greatly in their levels of sugar and acid.

Nutritional Value
Kraton fruit is a good source of fiber, pectin, phosphorous and calcium. Parts of the Kraton tree have anti-inflammatory properties and are used for the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery.

Applications
The interesting sweet and sour flavor profile of the Kraton make it a highly versatile fruit. It is often seen pickled in a salt and sugar brine and eaten as a sweet snack. A common local dessert involves macerating the pickled fruit into a sort of candy and then combining it with shaved ice. The fruit along with its pickling syrup may be used in cocktails, such as a Bloody Mary or Dirty martini.  Kraton is also used in savory applications, and seen in regional curry dishes that feature the fruit’s subtly fragrant and sour flavor.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Some Southeast Asian cultures use a decoction of the Kraton leaves in a bath to reduce fever or as a tonic for mothers after childbirth. Chemical studies show that the inherent anti-inflammatory constituents of the tree would indeed be beneficial in such folkloric medicinal treatments.

Geography/History
Kraton is native to the Malaysian peninsula, but has since been naturalized throughout Southeast Asia and is cultivated in India, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, Borneo, Indonesia, the Moluccas, Philippines, Mauritius and domestically in Florida. The Kraton tree is a tropical species and not tolerant to frost, but can thrive in both dry and moist environments.

Lemons Sweet
Image link: sppics/10363.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The Sweet lemon is medium-sized with an overall rounded shape and a slightly flattened bottom. Its rind is yellow with a pale green tint and later develops an orange hue when fully ripe. The skin is relatively thin and smooth and is rich with aromatic oils. The juicy, greenish flesh has minimal seeds and is nearly acid-less. Unlike the Meyer lemon, which is sweet but still tastes like a lemon, the Sweet lemon is actually closer to the flavor profile of a lime; sweet and floral like rosewater with a mild tartness. The pulp is quite mild when compared to the fruit’s intensely aromatic zest.

Seasons/Availability
Sweet lemons are available year-round with peak season in the spring.

Current Facts
The Sweet lemon is botanically classified as Citrus limetta, and may be commonly referred to as sweet lime, sweet limetta, Persian lime and Mediterranean sweet lemon. In India it is called Mosambi where it is prized for its many health and beauty benefits. Confusingly, it looks like a lemon, yet tastes like a sweet acid-less lime, hence the numerous aliases. Two common varieties grown in California are the Millsweet limetta and the Ponderosa sweet lemon.

Nutritional Value
Sweet lemons are an excellent source of vitamin C and are beneficial for treating the common cold, sore throats and dehydration. Some homeopathic advocates use Sweet lemons to relieve gastrointestinal problems, boosts liver function and as a natural antiseptic. The juice may be used as a hair rinse and the halved fruit may be rubbed directly on the skin to reduce blackheads.

Applications
Use Sweet lemons to add a sweet, floral citrus note and a gentle acidity to sweet and savory dishes. Beware of using them interchangeably for traditional lemons, however, because they do not offer the same cutting acidity or intense flavor. The Sweet lemon’s low acid level and rich sugar content allow them to be eaten raw and freshly sliced just like an orange. In India the juice is often sweetened with a touch of honey and spiked with cumin, black salt or chaat masala, an Indian spice mix. The juice also makes an excellent sorbet, custard, vinaigrette or marinade. The aromatic peels of the Sweet lemon may also be captured by steeping them in a simple syrup for cocktails or infusing them into plain sugar for confectionaries. Sweet lemons compliment seafood, lamb, poultry, couscous, grapefruit, orange, lemon, berries, honey, vanilla, cinnamon and clove.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Sweet lemons are ubiquitous in the cuisine of the Middle East and are often used as an aromatic centerpiece on the kitchen table or for a natural remedy at any sign of a cold or cough.

Geography/History
The Sweet lemon tree may be found growing in tropical and subtropical climates and usually bears fruit within 5-7 years. The Millsweet limetta probably originated in the Mediterranean region and came to California from Mexico. The cultivar grew at the San Gabriel Mission in 1822 and received the name “Millsweet” in 1943.

Use the flesh in cold soups, jams, green salads or fruit salads, or pickle the rind. Orange watermelon will keep up two weeks in the refrigerator.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Some farmers in the mid-western United States say that a good indicator of a watermelons ripeness is to look for the presence of something known as "flea specks". The tiny black flecks are not from fleas but rather are a type of mold that grows on the exterior of the watermelon underside when the sugar content has reached its peak.

Geography/History
Watermelon dates back thousands of years to ancient Africa where it grew wild, thriving in the tropical and subtropical regions. Texts written by European botanists have been found that depict images and descriptions of watermelons of various shapes and sizes as well as varying flesh colors of red, white, yellow and orange.

Nectarines Carmen Miranda
Image link: sppics/5242.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Though it looks like a nectarine, the Carmen Miranda nectarines actually taste like a mango. This nectarine is rich, yellow-fleshed and low in acid.

Seasons/Availability
Late spring through summer.

Current Facts
Fitz Kelly, grower and owner of Fitzgerald's Orchard located in Reedley, California, measures the sugar content of his fruits with a refractometer, an easy to use compact device about the size of a regular banana. In order to measure the sugar content of the fruit, the fruit’s juice is dripped onto a crystal compartment on the device. The juice is trapped between two pieces of crystal, reminiscent to slides used in labs. Holding and looking at the refractometer against bright sunlight, a visible scale indicates the sugar content of the fruit. The highest reading being 30, a fruit with a reading of 14 or above is considered excellent. The highest reading on refractometer is 30 and Fitz tested a nectarine that actually went above 30. Now, that is super sweet!

Applications
Enjoy out of hand for a healthy between meal snack. Raw, jellied, cooked or candied, nectarines are a sweet treat. Prepare and serve like peaches. The skin is edible but may be removed.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The nectarine is one of the oldest of all fruits and is believed to be native to China. Nectarines are a member of the rose family and closely related to peaches and almonds. The nectarine, Prunus persica var. nucipersica, is a genetic variant of the common peach and is not a cross between a peach and a plum, as some believe.

Geography/History
Developed in the city of Modesto, California by a private grower, the Carmen Miranda nectarine is locally grown at Fitzgerald Orchard in Reedley, California. The center of the tree-fruit industry, Reedley, California has the ideal compatible climate for growing superior stonefruit. Premium nectarines are grown at Fitzgerald's Orchard located in Reedley and owned by Fitz Kelly.

Nectarines White
Image link: sppics/4211.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
White nectarines distinguish themselves from Yellow nectarine varieties in their balance of sugar and acid. White nectarines lack the acidity that yellow nectarines contain, thus they are referred to as sub-acid. Fruits are rounded and slightly heart-shaped with a single central groove. Their skin is paper thin, smooth and blushed with hues of ruby, pink and ivory throughout. The flesh is perfumed with aromatics, overtly juicy when ripe, and creamy in color. A ripe White nectarine's texture is tender firm with a melting quality, its flavors rich and decadently sweet with baking spice nuances.

Seasons/Availability
White nectarines are available during the summer months.

Current Facts
White nectarines, botanical name, Prunus persica nucipersica, are a stone fruit and species within the genus, Prunus, alongside cherries, apricots, plums and almonds. Nectarines are the result of a natural occurring genetic mutation of peaches. There are dozens of white nectarine varieties, with names such as Arctic Rose and Heavenly White. The season for White nectarines continues to expand with the introduction of early ripening nectarines that have been developed to reach the same level of quality and sweetness of their mid and late-summer counterparts. One of the most successful early ripening varieties is named Polar Lights, developed by revered stone fruit horticulturist, Floyd Zaiger.

Applications
White nectarines are best suited for fresh eating, yet they can also be poached, grilled, made into a compote, syrup, jelly and infused into drinks or added to dessert recipes such as cakes, pies and ice cream. White nectarines pair well with other stone fruit such as apricots, cherries and almonds, citrus, bramble berries, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, cream and custards. Savory companions include herbs such as basil, cilantro and arugula, hazelnut and pistachio nuts and oil, aged cheeses such as manchego, mild cheeses such as chevre and burrata and shellfish such as scallops and shrimp. White nectarines should be stored at room temperature until ripe, then refrigerated. The fruit will remain at that stage of ripeness and can be refrigerated for up to seven days.

Geography/History
Genetic studies have concluded that nectarines evolved due to a recessive allele. Without two copies of a gene, specific genetic traits will not be inherited. Thus, the nectarine naturally occurred as a fuzz-free peach. Bud mutations were isolated and planted as second generation trees to produce nectarine trees. Nectarines still naturally occur as bud mutations on peach trees. The trees' preferred climate is similar to that of the peach. Their growing regions are regulated by the seasons. Only in late spring and summer will fruit become ripe. Nectarine trees need cold weather during the winter in order for the buds to develop properly and a hot dry spring and summer for fruit to ripen. Cultivation occurs in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres which experience opposite summers and winters.

Seasons/Availability
Noni fruit is available year-round with gaping in the winter months.

Current Facts
Noni fruit, botanically known as Morinda citrifolia, grows on a small tropical evergreen tree in the Rubiaceae plant family. There are 80 types of Morinda that exist throughout its tropical growing regions with 3 varieties, including Morinda citrifolia var. citrifolia, being the most common. Due to its potent and unpleasant odor the Noni fruit is commonly referred to as "cheese fruit" or "vomit fruit".

Nutritional Value
Noni fruit contains natural enzymes and immune boosting anthraguinones and polysaccharides. Noni fruit boasts proxeronine, which aids in the absorption of vitamins and minerals, as well as vitamins A and C. Noni fruit is available for medicinal use in fresh, powdered, juice, tea and supplemental pill forms. Noni is used for a range of treatments from diabetes to fever, though the effectiveness has yet to be studied clinically and claims are not supported by the FDA.

Applications
Noni fruit can be consumed raw out of hand, though many find its flavor much more palatable blended as a juice. It is common practice to mix the pungent Noni fruit juice with other varying fruit juices to help mask the unpleasant flavor. Noni may be used in cooked applications such as curries and sauces, jams and jellies. Another common application is to cook the Noni fruit with other fruits, blend it and dry it into fruit leather.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
For over 2,000 years the Polynesian people have used Noni fruit and its tree for many basic survival needs. The wood of the Noni plant was burned for fire, the bark was ground up and used in the production of yellow and red cloth dyes, the leaves were fed to livestock as a supplemental feed and the fruit was consumed as a prescribed medicinal treatment. Because of its unpleasant flavor the Polynesian people considered the Noni fruit a "famine food", consumed for survival after natural disasters had wiped out most other vegetation.

Geography/History
Noni developed around the tropical islands surrounding New Guinea where its ability to thrive in new lava flows gave it a distinct advantage over all other native plants. Approximately 3,200 years ago the migrations of humans from the New Guinea area helped transplant the Noni to neighboring regions such as Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. The spread of Noni is directly related to the colonization of the Polynesian people and their culture throughout the Pacific.

Look for Cara Cara oranges beginning in January. The season of this special orange sweetie ends around the end of May.

Current Facts
Cara Cara oranges, botanically classified as Citrus sinensis, are commonly refereed to as "the pink navel". Cara Cara oranges are the result of a natural mutation discovered on a Washington navel orange tree. The Cara Cara orange tree exhibits many similar characteristics to the Washington navel orange tree, with exception to occasionally producing striped leaves and twigs that if are left to fruit may produce oranges with variegated rinds. The deep pink flesh of the Cara Cara orange is from the presence of a caroteniod, lycopene.

Use in savory or sweet preparations, paired with avocados, lettuces, fresh herbs, strong cheeses, fresh fruit, whole grains, and poultry. Use cara cara juice in curds, cocktails, vinaigrette and syrups. Cara cara oranges will keep up to two weeks, refrigerated.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The name orange actually refers to the fruit's scent, not its color. The word comes from the Sanskrit word "naranga", which comes from the Tamil word "naru", meaning fragrant. An old variety, the Brazilian type of navel orange is properly called "Bahia."

Geography/History
This orange originated at the Hacienda Cara Cara in Venezuela in 1976, hence its name. In 1870, the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. sponsored the first introduction of navel oranges to the United States, and of course, the fruits were called Washington Navel. In 1873, three branches of an orange variety from Brazil were given to Eliza Tibbets by an official of the United States Department of Agriculture. By 1878, she had three fruit-bearing trees and had begun the navel orange industry in Riverside, California. Today delicious descendants of the Washington navel orange are being enjoyed. Amazingly, one of those three original trees is still alive and still bearing fruit. The word "navel" comes from the development of a secondary fruit at the end of the main fruit which causes a belly-button look.Locally grown at Fallbrook, California, at Garcia Organic Farms, owner and grower Armando Garcia was one of the first farmers to cultivate Cara Cara orange about 10 years ago. Three weeks before the Cara Cara oranges are ready for harvest, Garcia Organic Farms stops watering the trees in order for the nurturing rays of the sun to develop optimum flavor in the fruit. Watering during this final stage of growth would water down the Cara Cara orange's great flavor. Proud of providing premium produce to the marketplace, family-owned Garcia Organic Farms is reputed for researching and growing newly released cultivars and for being one of the first to supply the market with exciting and diverse varieties. Armando's father assists in the agricultural research and gathers vital information to keep Garcia Organic Farms on the forefront of successful farming procedures.

Oranges Valencia
Image link: sppics/6165.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Valencia oranges are reputed for their exceptional juice. Medium to large in size, this orange has a thin easy-to-peel smooth deep orange colored rind. Slightly more acidic than the navel orange, it has only a few seeds. Valencia oranges continue to ripen after harvest; the longer this popular orange ripens, the sweeter the taste.

Seasons/Availability
Valencia oranges are available fall through spring.

Current Facts
Valencia oranges sometimes endure a natural process called "regreening" in late spring and summer. This process occurs when fruit is left on the tree during summer months. Warm temperatures cause a pigment called chlorophyll to return to the orange's skin which causes the greenish tint. The color of skin has no effect on the sweetness or quality of the orange. The world's most important commercial variety, Valencia oranges are often called summer oranges.

Nutritional Value
An orange offers more fiber than any other fruit, plus provides carbohydrates, calcium, iron, vitamin A and potassium. One average orange contains about 70 calories.

Applications
Valencia orange's nearly seedless pulp makes it ideal for juicing. Use in syrups, cocktails, smoothies or marinades. Pair Valencia orange segments with olives, mint, feta, onions, rice, chiles, melons, root vegetables, poultry, seafood, pastries and baked goods. Use as juice and zest to compliment butter, creams, honey, custards and vinaigrette. Valencia oranges will keep up to two weeks in the refrigerator.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The Valencia orange was named for a supposed similarity in looks to an old Spanish variety.

Geography/History
Locally grown at Garcia Organic Farms, Fallbrook, California, owner and grower Armando Garcia favors cultivating the Valencia orange because it offers premium orange juice. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, Brazil is the leader in world production of Valencia oranges followed by the United States.

Passionfruit
Image link: sppics/341.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Purple passionfruit is a small, oval to round shaped fruit, approximately two to three inches in diameter at maturity. The fruit's skin is smooth, yet dimpled and at peak maturity can be heavily wrinkled. The skin's color varies with hues of dark purple and red. Below the skin is a cottony white peel. The interior seed cavity is filled with edible yellow to green jelly and medium sized black seeds. Its pulp is highly aromatic and has a tropical sweet tart flavor with nuances of pineapple, papaya, mango, citrus and guava.

Seasons/Availability
Passionfruit is available year-round with peak season winter through summer.

Current Facts
Passionfruit, also known as Granadilla is of the family Passifloraceae. There are several varieties of passionfruit but the two main commercial types on the market today are the Purple passionfruit (Passiflora edulis L.) and Yellow passionfruit (P. edulis f. flavicarpa).

Nutritional Value
The pulp of the passionfruit is rich in Vitamins A and C and its edible seeds are an excellent source of dietary fiber. Its pulp has also been found to be rich in phytochemicals aka antioxidants, which have been shown to help to prevent certain cancers and support a healthy immune system. The flower of the passionfruit has been used for centuries by many cultures as a medicinal supplement to treat insomnia, asthma, anxiety and menopause. The inner white rind of the passionfruit is currently being studied as well for its ability to reduce asthma symptoms and alleviate the pain caused by osteoarthritis.

Applications
Purple passionfruits are prized for the jelly like pulp they contain, which can be used raw or cooked in a number of dessert and beverage preparations. Slice in half and use a spoon to remove the gelatinous contents. Both the pulp and seeds are edible and ready to eat as is, for a less tart flavor add a little sugar and cream to it before serving. Serve passionfruit atop salads, ice cream or yogurt. To remove the seeds squeeze the inner contents of the fruit through cheesecloth. The seed free pulp of the passionfruit can be cooked down to make syrup for use in beverages, sauces, soups, preserves, sherbets, pie fillings, frostings, marshmallows and cakes.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
The vines of the passionfruit produce large white flowers with intricate purple, green, black and yellow detailing. It is from these flowers that the passionfruit gets its name as Spanish missionaries felt the appearance of the flower had a resemblance to some of the symbolism found in the Passion of the Christ (the three stigmas as the three nails, the corona as the crown of thorns, the five stamens as the five wounds, the five petals and five sepals as the ten apostles and the purple petals as the purple robe).

Geography/History
The Purple passionfruit is a subtropical fruit native to southern Brazil, Paraguay and Northern Argentina. In the late 1800’s they were also found to be growing in the coastal areas of Australia then soon after made their way to Hawaii via seeds brought over from Australia. It grows vigorously as a vine and is able to stretch its branches across trellises, walls and the canopies of rainforest trees. Passionfruit thrives in warm to hot climates that experience moderate rainfall and rare frost. Commercial production today comes out of India, New Zealand, the Caribbean, Brazil, Columbia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Peru, Australia, Israel, Africa and in the United States from Florida and California.

Image link: sppics/11676.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The Yellow passionfruit has a round to egg like shape and thick yellow skin, oftentimes tinged with spots of lime green. The interior of its rind has soft creamy white walls and encases an exceptionally juicy yellow-orange pulp and many petite brown seeds. Its flavor is sweet, acidic and tropical with mild floral notes. Growing on a climbing vine the Yellow passionfruit has green tendrils and leaves and will bloom prior to fruiting. The ornate and colorful flowers of the Yellow passionfruit are larger more aromatic than the Purple variety.

Seasons/Availability
Yellow passionfruit is available in the late winter and throughout the summer months.

Current Facts
Yellow passionfruit, botanically known as P. edulis f. flavicarpa is a perennial vine and a member of the Passifloraceae or Passion Flower family. There are close to 500 varieties of passion flower grown today, along with the Purple passionfruit the Yellow passionfruit is one of the only types of passionfruit commercially grown. The Yellow passionfruit when grown in ideal conditions will yield more fruit than the Purple variety.

Nutritional Value
Yellow passionfruit contains riboflavin and niacin and is rich in amino acids. They also are higher in citric acid and carotene than the Purple passionfruit though they have a lower content of ascorbic acid.

Applications
Yellow passionfruits are sought after for the gelatinous, sweet-tart pulp they contain on their interior. The pulp can be used raw or cooked in both sweet and savory preparations. The pulp with seeds can be used as is in fruit salads, cocktails or served a top yogurt and ice cream. Seeds can be removed or consumed along with the pulp. To remove the seeds strain the pulp through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer. The seed free pulp of the Yellow passionfruit can be boiled down and used to make jams, sauces, beverages, ice cream, sweet syrups, savory sauces, pie filings, quick breads and cakes.  To cut the tart acidity of the pulp when eating fresh add a little cream and sugar to the pulp.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
In Hawaii the Yellow passionfruit is known as Lilikoi and used as a flavoring for syrups and shaved ice. In Venezuela they are known as Parcha Amarilla and are commonly used to make ice cream, preserves and a popular bottled passionfruit, rum cocktail. The name passion was given by Spanish missionaries who saw the flowers and plant as a visual representation of the Passion of the Christ. The curled tendrils as the whips, the three anthers and five stamens as the nails and wounds, the ten sepals and petals as the ten apostles and the radial filaments at the center as the crown of thorns. The Yellow passionfruit is also utilized by chemists to produce a fragrant compound known as Oxane which is used to impart a tropical scent in products.

Geography/History
The traditional Purple passionfruit originated in the Amazon region of Brazil, Yellow passionfruit as well is thought to have possibly originated there as a hybrid of P. edulis (Purple passionfruit) and P. ligularis (Sweet Granadilla) or potentially as a chance mutant in Australia.  A tropical fruit, the Yellow passionfruit thrives in areas that receive adequate rainfall and sunshine. Its vines do well if sheltered from the wind and will be less susceptible to pests if allowed to grow climbing up a tree or trellis. Today it is grown commercially predominately in Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, India, Columbia, Brazil and Venezuela.

Peaches Indian Blood
Image link: sppics/7182.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Indian peaches are distinguished by dark red flesh, their fairly large size and their velvety thin skin with mottled layers of red tones throughout. Their tender firm flesh is marbleized with ruby and crimson red streaks from the skin to the fruit's stone. Indian peaches' high acid content contributes to a tart, brisk mouthful with undertones of blackberry, plum and baking spices.

Seasons/Availability
Indian Blood peaches grow at Penryn Orchards in Northern California, and are available for a short period during August.

Current Facts
Indian peaches AKA Iowa White peach, Cheroke Peach and Blood Red peach, botanical classification Prunus persica, are a very productive late season heirloom variety of freestone peaches. Freestone peaches are peaches whose seeds are easily removed from the flesh. There are only two other known varieties of peaches similar to the Indian peach, the Sanguine de Manosque and the Sanguinole peach, both heirloom varieties from France. They share the red-flesh trait, yet each variety ripens at different times and varies in size and climate temperance.

Applications
Generally, freestone peaches are fresh-eating peaches, yet Indian peaches are fairly versatile and have a reputation as a superior canning and baking peach. They can also be utilized for fresh fruit salads, for savory salads and appetizers, sauced into preserves or roasted and pureed. Complimentary pairings include other stone fruits, honey, egg custards, lavender, lemon, orange, cardamon, basil, arugula, cayenne, chiles, marcona almonds, mascarpone, burrata, chevre, vanilla, white chocolate, yogurt, hazelnut, pistachios and olive oil.

Sweet and succulent, sporting shades of deep yellow under a flattering red blush, the peach has a melting texture and somewhat lemony flavor. When ripe, this fruit yields to gentle pressure and releases a sweet fragrance.

Seasons/Availability
Summer.

Nutritional Value
Providing a source of carbohydrates, protein, dietary fiber and vitamin C, this nutritious fruit also contains boron known to boost estrogen levels in post-menopausal women, stimulate the brain and aid in prevention of osteoporosis. One medium peach has about 37 calories.

Applications
The very best way to eat a fresh peach is simply out of hand. Cut into sections, quarters or slices from the whole fruit, slicing down to the pit.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Referred to as the "queen of fruits", peaches are one of the four most popular fruits in the United States. It is said the skin of the peach has a feel reminiscent of human flesh. The Chinese, especially, revere the peach as a symbol of longevity.

Geography/History
Locally grown at renowned Tenerelli Orchards, Little Rock, California, this grand orchard is at 3000 feet elevation. Ideal location for growing premium peaches, this fruit requires cold nights and warm days in order to produce just the right amount of acid to give Late Harvest peaches the finest flavor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peaches White
Image link: sppics/4194.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
White peaches are low in acid, allowing for their natural sweetness to be more pronounced. Their skin is fuzzy and creamy white in color with blushes of red and pink. When ripe and at room temperature the fruit releases sweet aromatics. Like yellow fleshed peaches and nectarines, the amount of red or pink tones in the skin will differ with each variety, but has no bearing on the ripeness.

Seasons/Availability
White Peaches are available during the summer months.

Current Facts
Peaches, botanical name, Prunus Persica, are a stone fruit and species within the genus, Prunus, alongside cherries, apricots, plums and almonds. There are hundreds of varieties of peaches, ranging from heirloom to hybrid.

Nutritional Value
Peaches are high in vitamin C, dietary fiber, vitamin A, niacin and potassium.

Applications
White peaches can be substituted for Yellow peaches in fresh recipes. White peaches have a much more delicate flavor and texture, though.  Because of this, they tend to fall apart when cooked. Use these peaches in recipes where very little cooking needed. Peeling White peaches will enhance their flavor. They are wonderful fresh out of hand or sliced in both fruit and green salads. Serve alongside grilled meats or diced atop fish tacos for a sweet salsa. As a dessert, White peaches are great when paired with fresh cream or yogurt. Peaches store best at room temperature but can also be stored in the refrigerator to prolong their shelf life.

Geography/History
All peaches are native to China, where the only wild peaches still grow today. Documentation of the first cultivated peach was recorded in Chinese manuscripts as early as the 10th Century BC. Peaches were then brought via the Silk Road to the Fertile Crescent, which is now modern day Iran. The emergence of White peach varieties in the global market is a response to consumer demand for low-acid white-fleshed fruit, which has been favored for centuries in Asia. White peach tree cultivation now exists in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres which experience opposite summers and winters allowing for year round availability. Regions and seasons also determine peach production. White peach trees require wet winters for optimal bud production and hot dry summers for prolific, quality fruit. White peaches will not flourish in Oceanic climates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Persimmons Fuyu
Image link: sppics/6527.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The Fuyu persimmon is an improved variety that benefits from a trifecta of qualities; it lacks a core, seeds, and tannins (tannins equate to an astringent persimmon). Fuyu persimmons have a squat and rounded beefsteak tomato like shape and are capped with an indented leaf on their stem end. Fuyu boasts pumpkin colored tones in both skin and flesh and when ripe possess layers of flavor reminiscent of pear, dates and brown sugar with nuances of cinnamon. Their texture varies from crisp and succulent when young to more tender as they mature. Fruits are ready for harvest when skins are deep orange and unlike most other persimmon types have no astringency and are ready to eat when still firm.

Seasons/Availability
Fuyu persimmons are available from mid-fall through the winter months.

Current Facts
Fuyu persimmons, botanically known as part of Diospyros kaki, are an Oriental persimmon, a category of persimmons divided into two types; astringent and non-astringent. Fuyu are the most widely cultivated persimmon in the world and the leading non-astringent persimmon on the market, allowing for them to be eaten fresh out of hand at various times during maturation. Astringent persimmons, which will require being fully ripened prior to eating, are too fragile for shipping which lowers the commercial value of the fruit within a globally distributed food culture.

Nutritional Value
Fuyu persimmons contain significant amounts of fiber and vitamin A. Additionally they contain vitamin C and trace amounts of vitamin E, K and B-6.

Applications
Fuyu persimmons are often used as a substitute or in tandem with apples and pears, as their texture is crisp yet tender and flavor, sweet. Though there are other varieties better suited for preserving and jamming, Fuyus are considered the most versatile persimmon because of their ability to be used both when just ripe and when fully ripe. They can be eaten fresh out of hand or added to cold appetizers, salsas, and salads. They can be sliced and used as a topping for pizza, pies, tarts, yogurt, and toast. Cooked down and pureed Fuyu can be used to make persimmon cakes, breads, puddings, ice cream, and pie filling. Complimentary ingredients include cranberries, pomegranates, ginger, vanilla, nutmeg, cream, brown sugar, maple, soft and fresh cheeses such as mozzarella and mascarpone, pecans, pistachios, bacon, prosciutto, figs, mild lettuces and bitter greens, herbs such as basil, arugula and mint, citrus, balsamic vinegar and nut oils such as hazelnut and walnut. Fuyu persimmons can be kept at room temperature, they can also if preferred be refrigerated. In either scenario be sure not to store near apples or other ethylene producing fruits since they are ethylene sensitive and will ripen and spoil quickly when exposed.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
When in season the persimmon is a prized fruit in many parts of the world. In Greek Fuyu persimmon’s botanical name, Diospyros means “divine fruit”.  In Japan, persimmons are considered to be the country’s national fruit and the Fuyu is also known as Fuyugaki. In the United States persimmons of the Diospyros virginiana variety were introduced to the colonists by Native Americans who taught the colonists how to use the fruit to make puddings and bread. Today in the United States the popular Fuyu is now used in these two traditional American persimmon preparations. In the United States, the Fuyu persimmon makes up nearly eighty percent of the persimmon market nationally.

Geography/History
Persimmons have been cultivated for over a millennia in Asian countries and have long been an important fruit crop there, so much so that it is said that persimmons are to Asia as apples are to America. While persimmons of the group Diospyros virginiana had already been grown for some time in America Oriental type persimmons such as the Fuyu were first introduced to the United States in 1856 by Commander M.C. Perry. Commander Perry brought the seeds back from an American naval fleet visit to Japan, unfortunately none of the seeds planted upon return made it to maturity. Soon after this first attempt the U.S. Department of Agriculture imported seeds for a variety of different Oriental persimmons including the Fuyu from Asia. Since that time, many different types of Fuyu have been developed, and the Fuyu stands today as the most highly cultivated and commercially successful persimmon type. China produces upwards of three million tons annually of persimmons and is the leader in worldwide production. In the United States the Fuyu persimmon is grown predominately in California, specifically in the central San Joaquin Valley as well as in San Diego, Riverside and Orange County.

Persimmons Sharon Fruit
Image link: sppics/2577.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Sharon fruit has many characteristics which give it an edible advantage over other persimmon counterparts. It is seedless (or nearly seedless), has no core, void of any astringency or bitterness (a commonplace characteristic of so many varieties) and it can be eaten as a whole fruit, even when unripe. By appearance alone, though, Sharon fruit shares many common characteristics of other persimmon varieties. It has a somewhat oval tomato shaped resemblance with an indented leaf on its stem end, pumpkin colored tones in both skin and flesh and when ripe, possesses layers of flavors reminiscent of baking spices and brown sugar. Its texture varies from crisp and succulent when young to soft and custard-like as it overly matures. Sharon fruit are eaten fresh or cooked and preserved in dried and canned form.

Seasons/Availability
Sharon Fruit are available in fall into winter.

Current Facts
The Sharon fruit, scientific name, Diospyros kaki, has several vernacular names, many of which precede its current given name. These names include the Japanese Persimmon, Kaki Persimmon, Asian Persimmon and Korean mango. The most common name though that it should be associated with is the cultivar "Triumph". There are two types of persimmon cultivars: astringent and non-astringent. The Sharon fruit is an improved kaki (astringent) variety, meaning it has been modified to become a fruit better than its ancestors. The Sharon fruit, when picked is treated over 24 hours to carbon dioxide, thus removing its inherent bitter qualities and sweetening the fruit. This controlled atmospheric storage is not a new method; evidence suggests that harvested crops have been stored in controlled environments since the Egyptian period.

Nutritional Value
Sharon fruit's most highly regarded nutritional asset is its level of beta carotene found in both its skin and flesh. The beta carotene provides a highly proportionated level of vitamin A and Vitamin C. The fruit also has high levels of protein and glucose.

Applications
Sharon fruit can be used as a fruit in both sweet and savory applications. When ripe it is preferred fresh as a salad ingredient and dessert garnish. Persimmons can be added to salsas, used to create sauces, pureés, jams and used as an additional ingredient for marinades. Persimmons can also be baked, used as an principal ingredient in breads, cookies, cakes and ice creams. Sharon fruit pairs well with squashes, pumpkins, bright fresh cheeses such as mild chevre, aged cheeses such as manchego and parmesan. It also pairs well with pepitas, almonds, figs, pears, candied apricots, grilled shellfish and pork.

Geography/History
Sharon fruit is native to Israel and its parentage native to China, where persimmons have been cultivated since 1000 BC. There are thousands of cultivars that have been developed outside of China, specifically in Japan and Korea. The Sharon fruit began its prolific centuries of cultivation in the Sharon Plain of Israel, whose mild arid climate and long days of sun in summer contribute to trees bearing abundant harvests of fruit in late autumn through winter. Though persimmon seeds reached the United States first in 1856 via Commodore Perry in Japan, the USDA approved the fruit for distribution and additional varieties arrived between 1911 and 1913. The first documented picture of a mature Sharon fruit was in 1913. As Sharon fruit is an "astringent" type of persimmon, it ripens slowly, ships well and when stored at temperatures of 30º F its shelf life has been known to reach four months.

Plums
Image link: sppics/4244.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
All plums share three common characteristics: thin skin, a single central pit and a succulent flesh when ripe.  Colors vary depending on variety. Fruits can be deep purple, rose-hued, ruby red, green and gold.  The shape of plums is generally rounded with a central groove running longitudinal to the fruit's stem end. Flavors vary from sweet-tart to spicy and sub acid. Flesh consistency can vary from tender firm to having a melting quality. All plums continue to ripen once harvested.

Seasons/Availability
Plums are available during the summer.

Current Facts
Plums are a stone fruit and members of the Rosaceae family and classified under the genus, Prunus, along with peaches, cherries, almonds and apricots.  There are three species of plums, Japanese (P. salicina) European (P. domestica) and American (P. americana). Fruits vary in shape, size, flavor, and color according to cultivar. Subspecies include Damsons, Bullace and Greeengage. All plums share the same percentage of naturally occurring sugars, which is 10%.  However fruit breeding since the 19th century has increased plum cultivars' sugar content to reach above 20%. The benchmark plum variety is the Santa Rosa plum, a Japanese plum developed in America by Luther Burbank in 1906. Plums' greatest offspring is perhaps the pluot, a plum-apricot hybrid created to meet the demands of evolving palates.

Applications
Plums are a versatile culinary ingredient with possible uses centuries old.  They can be used for fresh eating, preserved using various methods, including pickling and of course, they can be dried to prune form. Plums can be used as a salad ingredient, as a compote for savory applications, used as the principle ingredient in desserts such as cakes, crumbles and ice creams and they can even be the base for a summer vinaigrette. Plums have a wide array of culinary pairings that are both savory and sweet.  Such pairings include anise, arugula, basil, cherries, chiles, cinnamon, cream, dates, figs, chocolate, nectarines, peaches, citrus, pork, lamb, aged and fresh cheeses, lettuce greens, almonds, pistachios, grilled scallops, brandy, red wine and light-bodied vinegars.

Geography/History
Japanese plums have origins in China but were first domesticated in Japan.  European plums evolved as a hybrid of the cherry plum and wild blackthorn (the wild plum of Europe and western Asia). American plums are native to North America. Each species is responsible for the hybridization of thousands of plum subspecies and varieties. All plums grow on flowering shrub-like trees that blossom in the spring, produce fruit in the summer and shed their foliage in the winter months.  Trees can reach up to 10 meters in height depending on variety. Plum trees are grown by grafting budwood onto rootstock. A common tree chosen for rootstock is the Cherry plum.  It is especially used for European varieties. Other common rootstock varieties include St. Julien, Pixy and the most versatile and hardy, the Viking.

Plums Armenian
Image link: sppics/12272.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Armenian plums, or the immature unripe fruits of the Cherry plum are lime green and approximately the diameter of a quarter. They are unsurprisingly very sour and crunchy and have the acidic quality of tart green apple and lemon. When sliced and salted, Armenian plums are often served with a drizzle of honey.

Seasons/Availability
Armenian plums are available in the spring.

Current Facts
Armenian plums are the green unripe fruits of the Cherry plum also known as Myrobalan plum. They are a favorite in the Middle East and often eaten with salt or preserved as a pickle. Many cultures around the world, from Japan to Turkey eat the unripe, sour fruits of various plum cultivars. The Cherry plum species is native to western Asia. Although it is usually eaten in its unripe version, the mature pinkish yellow fruits are also eaten as a sheet of dried fruit pulp.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plums Greengage
Image link: sppics/5286.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Brushed with a characteristic whitish protective dust, the greengage plum sweet-tart.

Seasons/Availability
Greengage plums are available during the summer months.

Current Facts
"Greengage" is the English name for a group of exceptionally excellent plums, usually green, which derive from the bullace and are also known as Reine Claude plums. Plums are closely related to cherries, size being mainly the distinction between the two.

Nutritional Value
Plums provide a useful amount of vitamin C, riboflavin and other B vitamins, plus some potassium. One medium-sized fruit contains about 36 calories and is a source of pectin and cellulose, beneficial dietary fibers. Eating five daily servings of fruits and vegetables lowers the chances of cancer. A recent study found eating nine or ten daily servings of fruits and vegetables, combined with three servings of low-fat dairy products, were effective in lowering blood pressure.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
"Plum" meant virtually any dried fruit in the Middle Ages and underlies names such as "plum pudding" and "plum cake". Roman authors noticed plums in the first century AD. The gardens of medieval monasteries in England enjoyed the cultivation of this especially loved fruit. Chaucer described a garden with "ploumes" and "bulaces" in his writings in 1369.

Plums Satsuma
Image link: sppics/10993.png
Image link: sppics/7145.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Satsuma plums are round with a pronounced mottled green skin and a maroon blush. With a firm texture, the Satsuma plum has a tough skin that can sometimes be bitter. Its meaty flesh is a deep red color and offers a juicy consistency. The Satsuma plum has an overall mildly sweet flavor with hints of almond.

Seasons/Availability
Satsuma plums are available in the mid-summer months.

Current Facts
Satsuma plums are a Japanese variety botanically known as Prunus salicina, as opposed to the European Prunus domestica. Satsuma plums are considered to be a long-time favorite of California plum-lovers. The hybridization of plums and the release of pluots and apriums have lessened the popularity of these Japanese plums.

Applications
A meaty and juicy flesh makes the Satsuma plum well-suited for jams and sauces. Peel the firm skin and puree the deep-colored pulp to make plum sorbet or dehydrate for fruit leather. Satsuma plums are good for baking, in muffins and pies or as a nice surprise in an upside-down cake. Satsuma plums add color (and a bit of a stain) to fruit salads and a sweet accent to green salads. The Asian plums can last up to two-weeks when refrigerated.

Geography/History
Named for a province in Japan, Satsuma plums were once referred to as ‘Blood plums’ for their intensely-colored red flesh. The Japanese plums were brought to California in the late 19th century, where their low chill requirement was well-suited to the Southern California climate. Satsuma plums are not commercially available; however, they can be found at local farmers markets and in home gardens.

Pomelo
Image link: sppics/5841.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The Pomelo is roughly globular to oblate in shape and varies in size and color. Its peel is overwhelmingly thick with a cotton-textured pith. Though the peel is easily removed, it can grow up to five inches deep. The skin is green when young and transforms to a brilliant yellow as it matures. Its pulpy segmented flesh ranges in color tones from pale to rich rosé pink to translucent yellow. The fragrant flesh can be juicy or lean depending on variety and age. Pomelos are semi-acidic, giving them their sweet tart flavor. Most Pomelo varieties contain only a few seeds, though if cross-pollinated with another variety, the fruit will bear multiple seeds.

Seasons/Availability
Pomelos are a winter citrus.

Current Facts
The Pomelo is also known as Shaddock, after its "discoverer". It has many other common names though, as there are at least fifteen different known varieties including Sweetie, Thong Dong and Chandler, one of the most popular varieties of Pomelos. It is the largest and most imposing of all citrus fruits. It has been scientifically linked to the grapefruit as one of its parent fruits.

Applications
Every bit of the heavy pith and membrane must be removed to make this giant gem edible. Cut off ends; score skin; peel away pith and rind. Separate segments, pulling or cutting off the membrane. Serve like grapefruit sections. Pair with seafood, coconut, papaya, peanuts, chile, garlic, and Thai or Asian spices. The thick peel may be candied. To store, refrigerate. Use promptly for optimum quality and flavor.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Pomelo is a staple fruit in Vietnamese food culture and cuisine. It is used for its flesh and its peel, which serves as a vessel for several core culinary preparations.

Geography/History
The Pomelo is native to southeastern Asia and all of Malaysia. Unlike most other citruses, it thrives in tropical lowlands and brackish water conditions. The Pomelo's journey West began with the East Indian ship captain, Shaddock, who first brought the fruit's seeds to the West Indies from the Malay Archipelago in the mid-seventeenth century. Thus, the reference to Shaddock. The Pomelo has little significant commercial crop value in the United States and has limited growing regions throughout Southern California and Florida.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pomelo Chandler
Image link: sppics/11864.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Like other pomelos, Chandlers are very large for citrus. Chandlers are particularly large and round, with a yellow to yellow-pink rind. The flesh is light to dark pink and ricey in texture but still juicy. Seeds are usually present in abundance, but only when cross-pollinated by fertile citrus types. The flavor is mostly sweet with some acidic notes, and Chandler pulp may even have contrasting tastes in different sections.

Seasons/Availability
The Chandler pomelo is available mid-winter through early spring.

Current Facts
The Chandler pomelo is one of many Citrus maxima varieties. Citrus maxima, known by its common name of pomelo, is a large, fairly sweet citrus fruit that has been used in the parentage of other citrus such as grapefruit and tangelos. Less common names include pummelos, shaddocks, and Chinese grapefruit. The Chandler pomelo is a hybrid of the Siamese Pink and Siamese Sweet varieties.

Nutritional Value
Pomelos are extremely high in Vitamin C, and Chandlers are no exception. They also contain potassium, magnesium, Vitamin B6, and dietary fiber. Their dietary properties make them helpful in preventing colds and for digestion.

Applications
Pomelos are most commonly eaten fresh or made into juice. To eat a fresh pomelo, score and remove the rind, peel off the pith, and cut or divide into sections. Alternatively, cut it in half and scoop out with a spoon. Pomelos are also juiced and made into jam, or cut up into salads. The flesh pairs well with other tropical fruits, herbs such as cilantro and mint, fish, and chicken. Add it to dishes near the end of the cooking period, since pomelos can taste bitter when heated. The skin is thick and bitter, but can be candied or made into marmalade. Choose Chandler pomelos that feel heavy for their size and have a floral scent with unblemished skin. Chandlers should be yellow rather than green when ripe, and have soft skin. Pomelos store well because of their thick flesh; place either in a cool, dry location or in the refrigerator.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Pomelos have been used for more than food in these countries, and are used in traditional medicinal practices to treat coughs, fevers, and digestive issues. Pomelo tree wood is used to make tool handles, while the flowers are made into perfume.

Geography/History
Pomelos are native to southeast Asia where they grow wild and are easily cultivated. They grow in abundance in countries such as Malaysia, Fiji, China, and in Hawaii. Commercially, they are grown in Asia, Israel, California, and Florida. When they were introduced to the Americas by an English explorer in the seventeenth century, they did not grow well everywhere but were later used to parent other citrus types such as the popular grapefruit. Along with many other pomelo varieties, the Citrus Research Center at the University of California Riverside specifically developed the Chandler pomelo. The first budwood was collected in 1959, and released for commercial production in 1961.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pomelo Mato Buntan
Image link: sppics/11989.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The Mato Buntan variety is on the medium to large end of pomelo sizes. It is obovoid or pear shaped and light-yellow with a coarse skin. Inside, the flesh is yellow-green when ripe and fairly seedy. It is less juicy than some pomelos, with a sweet and sometimes faintly bitter or acidic taste.

Seasons/Availability
The Mato Buntan pomelo is available mid-winter through spring.

Current Facts
Pomelos are a type of citrus that is very large, two to three pounds on average. They are one of the parents of grapefruits, and are increasing in popularity in North America. The Mato Buntan pomelo, or Citrus maxima 'Mato Buntan,' is an eastern Asian variety that is popular in Japan and Taiwan.

Nutritional Value
Pomelos are an excellent source of Vitamin C. One cup of fruit has almost two hundred percent of the daily recommended amount of Vitamin C. It is also a source of potassium and dietary fiber, and is low in calories and other nutrients.

Applications
Pomelos are most often eaten fresh, like a grapefruit—slice them into sections, peel them into segments, or cut them in half and scoop out the flesh. They can also be squeezed into juice or made into james, jellies, and desserts. When cooking, pomelos make a nice addition to salads, or seafood or chicken dishes. They work well with herbs like mint and chili pepper, and other tropical fruits such as mangos and pineapple. Mato Buntan pomelos that are heavy will have the most juice. They can be stored for two weeks on the counter and several weeks in the refrigerator.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Pomelos are more than just a healthy and delicious citrus. They feature in Chinese and southeast Asian Lunar New Year celebrations. Various parts of the pomelo plant are also sometimes used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments from lung problems to ulcers.

Geography/History
The various names for pomelos trace out the fruit's history. Their names include Jabong, Chinese grapefruit, and Shaddock. Pomelos are native to southeastern Asia, where they still grow wildly and abundantly. They were then brought to China and possibly introduced to the western hemisphere by Captain Shaddock in the 1600s. Mato Buntan pomelos specifically are thought to have been brought from southern China to Taiwan around 1700, and then made their way to Japan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pomelo Reinking
Image link: sppics/11859.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Reinkings are medium to large in size and somewhat pear shaped or bell shaped, with a flat bottom. The rind is yellow and rough rather than smooth. The flesh is light yellow in color and juicy, but is also described as ricey, a reference to the texture. Like many pomelos, Reinkings tend to be very seedy and the taste is sweet and pleasant with a mild tartness.

Seasons/Availability
The Reinking pomelo is available mid-winter through early spring.

Current Facts
The Reinking pomelo, or Citrus maxima 'Reinking," is a variety of pomelo, one of a number of a large, sweet citrus fruit that has been used in the parentage of other citrus such as grapefruit and tangelos. Less common names include pummelo, shaddock, and Chinese grapefruit. The Reinking pomelo's exact parentage is unknown, but it was once thought to be a hybrid of Kao Phuang pomelo and Shamouti sweet orange. Recent tests have determined that the variety probably resulted from a cross of Kao Phuang with unidentified pomelo pollen rather than a sweet orange.

Nutritional Value
Pomelos are extremely high in Vitamin C, and Reinkings are no exception. They also contain potassium, magnesium, Vitamin B6, and dietary fiber. Their dietary properties make them helpful in preventing colds and in digestion.

Applications
Pomelos are most commonly eaten fresh or made into juice. To eat a fresh pomelo, score and remove the rind, peel off the pith, and cut or divide into sections. Alternatively, cut it in half and scoop out with a spoon. Pomelos also have a surprising number of culinary applications. They are juiced, made into jam, cut up into tropical salads, and added to chicken or fish dishes. Pomelos should be added to dishes near the end of the cooking period, since they can taste bitter when heated. While the rind is thick and very bitter when raw, it doesn't have to go to waste. It can be made into marmalade or candied, or even used to flavor soups. Choose Reinking pomelos that feel heavy, which will have the most juice. Pomelos store well because of their thick flesh; place either in a cool, dry location or in the refrigerator.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Pomelos are popular in Asian countries such as China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, but are growing in popularity in the United States. In many Asian countries, pomelos are a sign of good luck at the Lunar New Year, and are part of some traditional medical practices.

Geography/History
Pomelos are native to southeast Asia and grown wild in countries such as Malaysia and Fiji. They were introduced to China around 100 B.C.E., and then were brought to the Caribbean by an English explorer in the seventeenth century. They did not take well to most parts of the Western Hemisphere, but have been used in the parentage of grapefruit. Commercially, they are grown in Asia, Israel, California, and Florida. Reinkings specifically are thought to have been developed in the 1940s, and budwood was first brought to the U.S. Date and Citrus Station in 1965.

Pomelo Tahitian
Image link: sppics/11920.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
The Tahitian is a relatively small pomelo, although still larger than a grapefruit. This variety is round with slightly flattened ends, and has a thin, yellow-green rind when ripe. The rind peels off easily to reveal juicy, green flesh that turns amber colored as it ripens to full maturity. The flesh tends to have many easy-to-remove seeds. The unusual taste is fairly sweet with notes of melon and lime, and subtler notes of grapefruit.

Seasons/Availability
The Tahitian pomelo is available mid-winter through early spring.

Current Facts
The Tahitian pomelo, or Citrus maxima 'Tahitian', one of many varieties of the large pomelo citruses. The Tahitian pomelo is also known as the Sarawak pomelo, or Moanalua. Though it is relatively new to the United States, Tahitian pomelos have been used to create new pomelo and grapefruit cultivars, although its own parentage is unknown.

Nutritional Value
Like other pomelos, Tahitians are extremely high in Vitamin C. They also have smaller amounts of potassium, magnesium, Vitamin B6, and dietary fiber.

Applications
Tahitian pomelos are delicious eaten fresh or made into juice. The easiest way to eat a fresh pomelo is to cut it in half, then cut into slices or scoop out with a spoon, much like a grapefruit. Fresh pomelos are often eaten sprinkled with salt and chile pepper in southeast Asia, but can also be used to make jam, salads, and in desserts such as citrus bars and sorbet. They go well with tropical fruits, herbs such as mint and cilantro, carrots, radishes, and shellfish dishes. Although bitter when raw, pomelo rind can also be candied or made into marmalade. Choose Tahitian pomelos that feel heavy and smooth, fully yellow skin. They can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Pomelos are commonly grown and eaten in southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Fiji, as well as in China. They are considered a source of good luck during the Lunar New Year.

Geography/History
Originally, all pomelos are from southeast Asia, and then made their way to China and the Caribbean. Today they are grown extensively in countries such as Malaysia and China. In North American, they are grown in Mexico, the Caribbean, Florida, and California, although they are mostly grown in small commercial plots or in home gardens. Tahitian pomelos are thought to have originated in Borneo and then traveled to Tahiti, from which they take their name. They were then introduced to the United States via Hawaii in 1971.

Applications
Pomelos are easy to eat raw and are often squeezed into juice. To prepare, cut the fruit in half and then into slices, or scoop out the flesh with a spoon. Peeling with a knife and dividing into sections is also simple. For more elaborate preparations, the flesh can be made into jam, cut up into salads, baked into desserts, or added at the end of cooking chicken or seafood dishes. The thick skin is inedible as is, but can be candied or made into marmalade. Choose pomelos that are heavy, have unblemished skin, and give off a floral scent. They can be stored for up to two months at room temperature if they are fresh, or in the refrigerator.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Pomelos occupy a prominent place in some Chinese cultures. In addition to being eaten at the Lunar New Year, pomelos are used in traditional medicine to treat a variety of ailments such as lung disorders, abdominal pains, and coughing.

Geography/History
Pomelos are native to southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Fiji and were introduced to China around 100 B.C.E. Legend has it that a sea captain named Shaddock brought pomelos to the Caribbean. Although they spread throughout the Americas, pomelos generally did poorly in North America. However, they were successfully crossed with wild oranges to develop grapefruit. Most pomelos are still grown in Asian countries and other tropical regions, but today are also grown in smaller quantities in California and Florida.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pomelo Valentine
Image link: sppics/11809.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Valentine pomelos are usually round with a protruding neck at the stem end, similar in shape to a pear. The rind is dark yellow and easy to peel, while the pulp inside is bright red. The fruit has a moderate amount of seeds, and is juicy and sweet especially compared with more acidic citrus. Other pomelos are a light green color when ripe, but Valentines are ripe when their rind is a uniform yellow.

Seasons/Availability
Valentine pomelos are available in the mid-winter through early spring.

Current Facts
The Valentine pomelo is a newly-developed Citrus maxima hybrid. Pomelos are also called pummelos, Chinese grapefruits, and Shaddocks. This fruit was bred by University of California Riverside Citrus Variety Collection staff, and was named Valentine since it ripens around Valentine's Day in the middle of February, and because a cross section of its red pulp often appears heart-shaped. Its parentage is a Dancy mandarin and Ruby blood orange hybrid crossed with a "Siamese Sweet" pomelo, resulting in a sweet taste, red flesh, and complex flavor. Budwood for gardeners and orchards interested in growing Valentine pomelos was first available from UC Riverside in 2009.

Nutritional Value
Like other pomelos, Valentines are extremely high in Vitamin C. They also have smaller amounts of potassium, magnesium, Vitamin B6, and dietary fiber. In addition to this nutrition profile, the Valentine's ruby red flesh indicates the presence of anthrocyanins, a class of antioxidants that may offer heart health benefits. Anthrocyanins are found in other richly colored red and purple produce such as berries and pomegranates.

Applications
Pomelos are most commonly eaten fresh or made into juice. To eat a fresh pomelo, cut off the top and bottom, slice off the rind, peel off the white pith, and cut out pulp sections. Another option is to cut the pomelo in half and cut into slices or scoop out with a spoon, much like a grapefruit. Fresh pomelos are often eaten sprinkled with salt and chile pepper in southeast Asia. More creative options include making Valentine pomelo flesh into jam or jelly, or slicing it into cold salads. The juicy, sweet flesh goes well with other tropical fruits such as mango and coconut, and with herbs such as cilantro and mint. For more cooking-intensive applications, add it to pasta or fish dishes near the end of the cooking period, since pomelos can taste bitter when heated. The skin is thick and bitter, but can be candied, which is a popular practice in China. The peel can also be made into marmalade, and flavor soups and desserts. Choose Valentine pomelos that feel heavy and have a floral scent with unblemished skin. They can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
In southeast Asia and China, pomelos are eaten in abundance particularly around the Lunar New Year since they are considered a sign of prosperity and good luck.

Geography/History
Pomelos are native to southeast Asia where they grow wild and are easily cultivated. A thousand years ago, pomelos were introduced to China, and were later brought to South American and the Caribbean in the late 1600s by an English sea captain. They did not grow well in the western Hemisphere; however, a hybrid of pomelos and wild oranges did. Americans know this hybrid as the grapefruit, a fruit that took off in popularity much more so than the pomelo. Commercially, pomelos are grown today mostly in tropical and subtropical regions in Asia, as well as in California and Florida in the United States.

Red Palm Fruit
Image link: sppics/9147.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
African Palm fruit, from the African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) are small, ovoid-oblong fruits that grow in clusters of several hundred, close to the trunk on short heavy stalks. The fruits range in size from less than 1 inch to 2 inches and are black and red when ripe. The fruit is fibrous and oily and surrounds a white kernel, also rich in oils. Oil from the palm fruit is difficult to describe, but is smoky, distinct and strong in both flavor and aroma. According to one Portuguese explorer, “It smells of violets, tastes like olives and has a color that blends foods together like saffron, but even all this can’t sufficiently describe its special qualities.”

Seasons/Availability
Because the oil palm produces fruit continuously year round, with new bunches ripening each month, the fruit is always in season.

Current Facts
Elaeis guineensis is a tree in in the Arecacaea family along with coconut and date palms. The tree is a tall palm, reaching up to 20 meters, with a ringed trunk and a crown of 20-40 large leaves. Male and female flowers grow on the same tree in separate clusters. The fruit is borne in bunches, starting 3-4 years after germination and will ripen in 5-6 months after pollination. Each bunch contains hundreds of fruits which are similar in size to a small plum. Oil palm is the world’s number one fruit crop, produced in 42 countries worldwide on about 27 million acres. About 90% of palm oil produced finds its way into food products, the remaining 10% going to industrial uses, including soap, candles, lubricating greases and as an ingredient in pharmaceuticals.

Nutritional Value
Unrefined red palm oil is rich in antioxidants, vitamin E, vitamin A, vitamin K, carotenes, lycopene, tocotreinol, and tocopherols. It can be used in place of cod liver oil for correcting vitamin A deficiency. It is being used by governments throughout the world to fight nutrition and vitamin E deficiency. The red color derives from the very high levels of carotenes, more than 15 times the carotenes in carrots and 300 times that of tomatoes.

Applications
Two kinds of oil are extracted from the African oil palm: palm oil and palm kernel oil. Palm oil is extracted from the fibrous flesh surrounding the inner kernel. In its virgin state, this oil is red in color. At this point, it is full of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. It is used as a culinary ingredient in many African dishes. It can be used in soups and sauces, and for frying. A dish from Ghana called palm nut soup is made by boiling, mashing and straining the flesh of the fruit and cooking it down with meats and vegetables. Palm oil’s distinctive flavor makes it an essential ingredient in many African dishes. Commercially produced palm oil is bleached and used in a wide range of culinary applications. The second type of oil, palm kernel oil, is extracted from the inner seed of the fruit. It is similar to coconut oil, is solid at normal room temperature and is colorless. Palm kernel oil is used commercially, making ice cream, mayonnaise, baked good and confectionaries.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
African palm fruit has been providing oil and nourishment to Africans for at least 5,000 years. Some other names for this important fruit include Mchikichi, Mjenga, Mubira, Munazi, and Abe. In order to meet worldwide demand for palm oil, swaths of forest are cleared to let 75-150 palms stand per hectare. The fruit are usually harvested by hand using cutlasses by means of ladders and ropes; a man can harvest 100-150 bunches per day.

Geography/History
The African oil palm is native to tropical Africa. It is thought to have originated somewhere near Ethiopia, and was propagated throughout the continent from there. It was carried to the Middle East and India via trade routes as well as to China and Asia via the silk trade route. Archaeological evidence indicates that palm oil was important to the ancient Egyptians. It was introduced to the Americas via the slave trade and was a crop associated with slave plantations. Industrialized in the 1960s, in 2003 palm oil production equaled that of soybeans. Elaeis guineensis flourishes in humid groves of tropical climates, requires a relatively open area to grow and reproduce itself and thrives best in well maintained soil. It can be found in Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Uganda. And has been introduced to China, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Togo, Venezuela, and Zanzibar as well.

Shea Fruit
Image link: sppics/12903.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Shea fruit resembles a small green plum and consists of an oil rich nut surrounded by a thin, tart layer of fruit. The fruit is mildly sweet with a texture of ripe pear and is an important source of energy to local people. Shea butter has a mild, nutty flavor and is common in Sahelian cuisine.

Seasons/Availability
Shea trees produce their fruit throughout a regions rainy season.

Current Facts
Vitellaria paradoxa, or Shea, is a deciduous tree native to Africa. Resembling an oak tree, a Shea tree takes 10-15 years to begin bearing fruit, reaching maturity at 20-30 years, and continues to produce fruit for up to 200 years. It can grow to a height of 15-25 meters. The fruit surrounds a relatively large and oily nut that is used to make Shea butter, a product that is locally consumed or exported as a cosmetic ingredient.

Nutritional Value
The pulp surrounding the nut has significant amounts of carbohydrates, protein and fat as well as vitamins and antioxidants. The kernel within is rich in fat (42-48%), with both vitamins A & E, cinnamic acid (which provides UV protection), and has demonstrated both anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties.

Applications
Shea butter is used as a cooking oil and as a skin product. The leaves, fruit, and bark are used in a variety of applications including medicine and food. Once the fruit ripens, the thin green layer surrounding the inner kernel can be eaten raw or cooked. The nuts are then dried, cracked, cooked and processed into Shea butter which can keep for months or even years. The wood is hard and reportedly termite resistant; it is used for lumber and to make charcoal. The blossoms and fruit are processed into local medicines treating a variety of ailments including arthritis, congestion, and gastric pain.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Africans have been consuming both the fruit and the nut of the Shea tree for centuries. Europeans discovered the properties and benefits of Shea and began importing the nut and its products. Both farmed and wild trees are subject to the collection of the fruit and the nuts. Typically the nuts are gathered and processed by women and children in rural areas, providing an important source of income for these otherwise underserved populations.

Geography/History
The Shea tree grows in the savannah belt of sub-Saharan Africa. It is found in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Togo, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Guinea.

Nutritional Value
A good source of vitamin C and potassium, star fruit provides dietary fiber. One medium size fruit contains about 40 calories.  Eating five daily servings of fruits and vegetables lowers the chances of cancer.  A recent study found that eating nine or ten daily servings of fruits and vegetables, combined with three servings of low-fat dairy products, were effective in lowering blood pressure.

Applications
Requiring no peeling or seeding, simply enjoy star fruit out of hand. Add to fruit and vegetable salads. Blend with avocado. Kiwis, mangoes and bananas welcome its tasty company. Add its goodness to enhance yogurt. Puree with other fruits or by itself for yummy Bavarian creams, ices, mousses and sherbets. For a texture and flavor balance, combine with sweet soft fruits. Sauté with shrimp. For edible garnish, sauté slices a second or two; sprinkle with sugar to glaze. Pair with fish and poultry dishes. Substitute for lemon or lime slices to garnish chilled beverages and cocktails. If green-ribbed fruit is purchased, let ripen until yellow unless a sharp tart taste is preferred. A full floral-fruity aroma is a sign it will taste its best. Keep at room temperature, turning occasionally, until its fragrant "perfume" develops.  Store at room temperature if served in a day or two. Refrigerate ripe fruit.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
Growing throughout Southeast Asia, star fruit is cherished for its sweet-tart acid taste and delightful presentation.  Indonesians call it belimbing and belimbing manis; in Thailand, star fruit is called madun; and in the Philippines, it is called balimbing.

Geography/History
Native to Sri Lanka, the Moluccas, India and Indonesia, star fruit is considered to be a relatively "new" fruit and is now cultivated in the United States. Southeast Asia and Malaysia have cultivated star fruit for hundreds of years. Belonging to the wood sorrel family and of the species Averrhoa carambola, star fruit has a close relative called "belimbing". Other names include Carambola, Chinese star fruit, star apple and quite appropriately, five-angled fruit. This scented fruit was named after a twelfth century Arabic physician and philosopher, Averrhoes. Grown in Asia, South America, Central America, the Caribbean and Hawaii, trees were acquired from Hawaii and brought to the American mainland nearly one hundred years ago. Only recently has star fruit been readily available in American markets. Florida is a major producer.

Star Fruit Taiwanese
Image link: sppics/20022.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Taiwanese Star fruit are a larger and more flavorful version of the domestic star fruit that we may be more familiar with. Its flavors are best showcased when the fruit is at its peak ripeness. The color of the fruit is the first signal of just how ripe the fruit may be. Younger fruits tend to have a greener sheen, less weight and considerably less aromatics. As the fruit ripens it will become yellow, often with an amber hue, its aromatics will be tropical with notes of pineapple and citrus. These aromatics are also prominent in the flavor of the fruit. The fruit has a crunchy somewhat transparent skin and its flesh's texture is succulent, similar to an apple or pear. The entire fruit is edible, skin flesh and seeds.

Seasons/Availability
Star Fruit is available year-round.

Current Facts
Carambola, commonly known as Star fruit, scientificly known as, Averrhoa carambola, are actually a berry fruit of an evergreen tree. This fruit is simply defined by the 5 prominently shaped ribs connecting to form a familiar star when sliced. Carambola fruit has been developed into multiple varieties, Two Forest , Slant Tail, Malay, and TaiFarm #1, just to name a few. These varieties make up the sweeter fresh eating type of Carambola. There are tart varieties that are also grown, ultimately as ingredients for processed foods.

Applications
Taiwanese Star Fruit are best eaten fresh. Typically they are sliced into ubiquitous stars, utilized in fruit salads and as garnishes, though more imaginative applications certainly showcase the fruit for its flavor and textural appeal. Taiwanese Star Fruit pairs well with citrus fruits and bright, rich flavors. Perfect companion ingredients include pomegranates, tangerines, pork belly, creme fraîche, mascarpone, and avocados. The fruit can be slightly grilled to render more juice and flavor. It can also be made into a jam or compote and utilized for breakfast and savory main dishes. To really capture flavor and texture, Taiwanese Star Fruit can be dried or dehydrated into chip form. To store, ripen at room temperature until it develops its characteristic floral scent. If used within a day or two, keep at room temperature. Otherwise refrigerate for up to one week.

Geography/History
Taiwanese Star Fruit gives the illusion to the idea it is native to Taiwan. However, its history dates back to trading via the Silk Road  during the Tang Dynasty in China. It was brought to Taiwan from mainland China in the 18th Century and has since become a symbolic fruit and important agricultural commodity for the country. Taiwan's vast tropical landscape allows for the fruit to be cultivated and harvested year-round - a feat independently opportune to Taiwan. Taiwanese Star fruit grows in other tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world, including Thailand, India, Oceana, Central and South America and Hawaii.

Ugli Fruit
Image link: sppics/296.png
------------------------------------------------

Description/Taste
Ugli™ fruit, is wrapped in a rough, puffy, slightly loose-fitting greenish-yellow to orange fragrant skin. Ranging in size from an overgrown navel orange to a hefty grapefruit, the nearly seedless pinkish-orange or sunshiny yellow-orange pulp contains tender large juice sacs that offer a soft fleshiness. The fruit is similar to a grapefruit with one important distinction: It is sweet, unlike the grapefruit and does not have a tart after taste. The older the fruit looks on the outside, the sweeter it is on the inside. Its acid-sweet, zesty, pungent flavor is somewhat reminiscent to that of an orange. Some fans say it tastes more like a mandarin with faint overtones of pineapple or honey.

Seasons/Availability
Ugli™ fruit is available from Jamaica on a limited basis typically winter through spring and is best adapted to tropical climates. This unique fruit is available from Florida in early summer.

Current Facts
Ugli™ fruit, botanically known as Citrus reticulate X paradise, was named and trademarked in 1934 when an importer of the fruit specifically ordered "...more of that ugly fruit...". Ugli™ fruit, pronounced OO-gli, is a natural tangelo hybrid between a grapefruit, seville orange and a tangerine. The original Ugli™ fruit importer has used improved scions to create the version of the fruit we know today. Ugli™ fruit is also sold under the moniker Uniq fruit.

Nutritional Value
A good source of vitamin C, Ugli™ fruit is high in fiber.

Applications
Despite its thick skin, this odd looking fruit is easy to peel. Cut fruit holds an abundant amount of wonderful juice. Possibly addicting, sprinkle halves lightly with sugar and let sit for a minute or two. Scoop out fruit with a serrated spoon. Mix sections in fruit and vegetable salads. To enhance flavor, pair with avocado and, remarkably, sweet onions will bring out its best flavor. Bitter herbs and leaves also love to be near this fruit such as chicory and radicchio. Grapes, bananas and strawberries enjoy its company, too. Great in compotes or gelatin molds. Use grated rind as flavoring. Candy the peel for a sweet snack. Refrigerate only if fruit is not to be used within a couple of days. Refrigerated fruit keeps about three weeks.

Geography/History
Ugli™ fruit was discovered growing wild in 1924 by a gentleman named F.G. Sharp at Trout Hall, near Brown’s Town in Jamaica. Ugli™ fruit was developed commercially by the same family which discovered the original tree and was originally marketed as The Exotic Tangelo from Jamaica™. Today, the Ugli™ fruit is grown and exported from Jamaica and Florida.
